        "Abstract":"In recent years irritability has received increasing attention among mental health professionals given its transdiagnostic associations with diverse forms of psychopathology . In contrast to other emotional states and traits however literature addressing associations between irritability and related temperament and personality constructs is limited . In addition those who study irritability have diverse perspectives on its neurobiological substrates . In this comment we situate irritability in the literatures on child temperament and adult personality and describe a model in which irritability derives from low tonic dopamine levels and low phasic DA reactivity in subcortical neural structures implicated in appetitive responding . We note that different findings often emerge in neuroimaging studies when irritability is assessed in circumscribed diagnostic groups versus representative samples . We conclude with directions for future research and propose that more authors use hierarchical Bayesian modeling which captures functional dependencies between irritability and other dispositional traits that standard regression models are insensitive too . Treatment implications are also considered .",
        "Highlights":"Irritability is a transdiagnostic feature of a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Irritability reflects extreme expression of temperamental negative emotionality. Neural substrates of irritability include low midbrain dopamine activity reactivity. Irritability can be expressed as both a mood state and an emotion."

To overcome this barrier drug encapsulating nanoparticles or vesicles drug conjugates and other types of drug delivery systems have been developed .

Recently among the various brain targeting ligands previously studied for facilitating transcellular BBB transport several sugar appended nanocarriers for brain delivery were identified . Meanwhile cyclodextrins have been used as nanocarriers for drug delivery since they can encapsulate hydrophobic compounds with high biocompatibility . Therefore in this study we created various sugar appended cyclodextrins to discover novel brain targeting ligands .

        "Abstract":"Drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye is challenging due to several anatomical and physiological barriers . Thus there is a need for prolonged action and targeted drug delivery to treat retinal diseases . Intravitreal injections avoid anterior eye barriers but the vitreoretinal interface and inner limiting membrane may prevent access of drug delivery systems to the retina . Existing data on retinal permeation of intravitreal nanoparticles are sparse and probably misleading due to the inter species differences of retinal structures in rodents and humans . To bridge this gap retinal permeation of light activated liposomes was studied in an ex vivo bovine explant system that simulates the structure of vitreoretinal interface and intact ILM . Our findings indicate that the particle size plays a significant role in determining the retinal penetration as the liposomes of 100nm sized failed to overcome the ILM and could not permeate into the retina . In addition our results demonstrate the impact of surface charge and PEG coating on retinal penetration . Small anionic liposomes with PEG coating showed the most extensive distribution and cellular localization in the retina . In summary this study extends understanding of ocular barriers and provides valuable information to augment design of retinal drug delivery systems .",

Only small liposomes below 100nm can overcome vitreoretinal interface barrier. PEG coating improves retinal permeation. Liposomes are capable of localization to the retinal ganglion cells."

This frequently results in enrichment of invasive and metastatic drug resistant tumor cells subpopulations cancer recurrence and eventually patient mortality . Thus there is an urgent need to identify specific markers by which the targeted imaging and or therapeutic guided missile like agents can specifically detect and or eradicate all cancer cells within a heterogeneous tumor while leaving the normal cells intact .

        "Abstract":"Adeno associated virus is a promising vector for gene therapy but its broad tropism can be detrimental if the transgene being delivered is harmful when expressed ubiquitously in the body i.e . in non target tissues . Delivering the transgene of interest to target cells at levels high enough to be therapeutically effective while maintaining safety by minimizing delivery to off target cells is a prevalent challenge in the field of gene therapy . We have developed a protease activatable vector platform based on AAV9 that can be injected systemically to deliver therapeutic transgenes site specifically to diseased cells by responding to extracellular proteases present at the disease site . The provector platform consists of a peptide insertion into the virus capsid which disrupts the virus ability to bind to cell surface receptors . This peptide contains a blocking motif flanked on either side by cleavage sequences that are recognized by certain proteases . Exposure to proteases cleaves the peptides off the capsid activating or switching ON the provector . In response to the activation the provectors regain their ability to bind and transduce cells . Here we have designed a provector that is activated by cysteine aspartic proteases which have roles in inflammation and apoptosis and thus are elevated at sites of diseases such as heart failure neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic stroke . This provector demonstrates a 200 fold reduction in transduction ability in the OFF state compared to AAV9 reducing the virus ability to transduce off target healthy tissue . Following exposure to and proteolysis by caspase 3 the provector shows a 95 fold increase in transduction compared to the OFF state . The switchable transduction behavior was found to be a direct result of the peptide insertion ablating the ability of the virus to bind to cells . In vivo studies were conducted to characterize the biodistribution blood circulation time neutralizing antibody formation and targeted delivery ability of the caspase activatable provector in a model of heart failure .",

We also investigated the components of the peritoneal tumor stroma that facilitated nanoparticle tumor interaction .

Decades after Schrdinger life scientists are still fascinated by the riddle that entropy can only accumulate in physical systems which often leads to biological deterioration and death but life finds ways to persist and prevail . So to say life negates entropy . Can this fascination and research concept be broadened even further to human culture Short after Schrdinger s publication Claude Shannon coined the term information entropy . Information entropy accumulates when noise interferes during communication . Eventually all useful information is lost . Yet from this observation something surprising can be inferred . Not only biological life but also cultural life has the ability to persist and prevail in spite of the accumulation of entropy . Does this insight mean that cultural life also negates entropy in Schrdinger s sense These questions guided me over several years of research during which I developed and tested a new theory of culture based on variation selection processes and homeostatic regulation . My contribution is to discover that these two processes not only make statements about biological life . They also explain some of the most important phenomena of culture returning fashions polarization diversification cycles of growth and reform and the formation of common ethos across entire bodies of knowledge . With access to big data and supercomputing I tested my theory against hundreds of thousands of news magazine articles books and TV transcripts as well as textual content collected from the social media . Historical institutional and geographical information was extracted from these data using a new method and new interactive tools were created to interpret the results . What should not be missed when reading this article is that the theory proposed here reveals a striking equivalence between nature and culture . The article states this equivalence in mathematical terms and contextualizes it in the history of science . The mathematical breakthrough is relevant because it aligns the humanities to science while also allowing for live evaluation of what I call cultural diversification cycles .",

Between multiple units of evolutionary selection there is homeostatic regulation. Within the units there are variation selection processes. Variation selection processes make the theoretical link between Shannon communication and dimensionality reductions such as topic modeling . Homeostatic regulation explains fashions cultural diversification as well as the evolution of common ethos across entire bodies of knowledge.

        "Abstract":"Here I use the rationale assuming that if of a certain trait that exerts its function in some aspect of the genetic code or more generally in protein synthesis it is possible to identify the evolutionary stage of its origin then it would imply that this evolutionary moment would be characterized by a high translational noise because this trait would originate for the first time during that evolutionary stage . That is to say if this trait had a non marginal role in the realization of the genetic code or in protein synthesis then the origin of this trait would imply that more generally it was the genetic code itself that was still originating . But if the genetic code were still originating at that precise evolutionary stage then this would imply that there was a high translational noise which in turn would imply that it was in the presence of a protocell i.e . a progenote that was by definition characterized by high translational noise . I apply this rationale to the mechanism of modification of the base 34 of the anticodon of an isoleucine tRNA that leads to the reading of AUA and AUG codons in archaea bacteria and eukaryotes . The phylogenetic distribution of this mechanism in these phyletic lineages indicates that this mechanism originated only after the evolutionary stage of the last universal common ancestor namely during the formation of cellular domains i.e . at the stage of ancestors of these main phyletic lineages . Furthermore given that this mechanism of modification of the base 34 of the anticodon of the isoleucine tRNA would result to emerge at a stage of the origin of the genetic code despite in its terminal phases then all this would imply that the ancestors of bacteria archaea and eukaryotes were progenotes . If so all the more so the LUCA would also be a progenote since it preceded these ancestors temporally . A consequence of all this reasoning might be that since these three ancestors were of the progenotes that were different from each other if at least one of them had evolved into at least two real and different cells basically different from each other then the number of cellular domains would not be three but it would be greater than three .",

In our study the spatial heterogeneity is induced by dissimilar dispersal rates between the patches . A large difference between the predator dispersal rates may stabilize the unstable positive equilibrium of the model . The existence of two ecological phenomena are found under independent harvesting strategy stability switching and hydra effect . When prey or predator is harvested in a heterogenious environment a positive stable steady state becomes unstable with increasing the harvesting effort and a further increase in the effort leads to a stable equilibrium . Thus a stability switching happens . Furthermore the predator biomass in both the patches increases when the patch with a higher predator density is harvested resulting a hydra effect .

Recently Colin Klein contends that PP FEP can not explain adaptive action with the same force that they deal with perceptions . In his answer to the objection Clark points out that FEP explains action desire and motivation on the basis of minimisation of energy . I argue that this answer begs the question of the unifying framework of FEP . I assume that FEP PP alone can not provide an ultimately compelling explanation of action . However I argue that when paired with a high level theory of psychology such as Theriault et al.s theory of social conformation in terms of the sense of should the coupled theories provide an inclusive symmetrical explanation of action . The symmetry of explanations is not a gap but a feature on this specific occasion .",

        "Abstract":"Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition is a natural and reversible process involved in embryogenesis wound healing and thought to participate in the process of metastasis . Multiple signals from the microenvironment have been reported to drive EMT . However the tight control of this process on physiological scenarios and how it is disrupted during cancer progression is not fully understood . Here we analysed a regulatory network of EMT accounting for 10 key microenvironment signals focusing on the impact of two cell contact signals on the reversibility of EMT and the stability of resulting phenotypes . The analysis showed that the microenvironment is not enough for stabilizing Hybrid and Amoeboid like phenotypes requiring intracellular de regulations as reported during cancer progression . Our simulations demonstrated that RPTP activation by cell contacts have the potential to inhibit the process of EMT and trigger its reversibility under tissue growth and chronic inflammation scenarios . Simulations also showed that hypoxia inhibits the capacity of RPTPs to control EMT . Our analysis further provided a theoretical explanation for the observed correlation between hypoxia and metastasis under chronic inflammation and predicted that de regulations in FAT4 signalling may promote Hybrid stabilization . Taken together we propose a natural control mechanism of EMT that supports the idea that EMT is tightly regulated by the microenvironment .",

Quantifying Waddingtons epigenetic landscape by mathematical modeling would be useful for understanding the mechanisms of cell fate determination . A few computational methods have been proposed for quantitative modeling of landscape however to model and visualize the landscape of a high dimensional gene regulatory system with realistic details is still challenging . Here we propose a Monte Carlo method for modeling the Waddingtons epigenetic landscape of a gene regulatory network . The method estimates the probability distribution of cellular states by collecting a large number of time course simulations with random initial conditions .

To identify prosperous businesses that create jobs and encourage economic development this study isolates businesses other than street vending enterprises with non family employees . Retrospective life history data from the Mexican Migration Project was used to estimate the annual probability of becoming an entrepreneur across 170 Mexican communities between 1975 and 2017 . This study found that any prior migration experience increases the probability of entrepreneurial entry relative to non migrants accumulated months of migration experience are positively associated with the probability of entrepreneurial entry undocumented status is associated with a lower probability of entrepreneurial entry . The positive effect of accumulated migration experience on entrepreneurship suggests that international migrants can accumulate human and financial resources that are essential to early stage entrepreneurship . Thus entrepreneurship represents an important pathway through which international migration can encourage economic development in less developed regions . At the same time the results suggest that that immigration policies in receiving countries can undercut migrants capacities to mobilize resources and contribute to economic development upon return . These findings suggest that target migration creates a winwin by addressing labor shortages in receiving countries while transferring resources to sending areas that enable economic mobility and development .",

In the former we find weak evidence that heterogeneity in individual returns increases contributions . In the latter we find that those facing a higher return would contribute more but no evidence that heterogeneity has an effect either way at the group level .

        "Abstract":"On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the CGIAR this paper revisits the genesis of the international center model for agricultural research . This model became fashionable in the 1960s and was arguably the major institutional innovation of the 20th century for foreign assistance to agriculture . While the founding of the first IARCs is universally attributed to the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations we argue that based on new evidence the creation of the IARCs was a logical conclusion of a process involving many actors that began immediately after World War I . First we review FAO efforts to build regional and global research networks for the major cereals in the immediate post WWII period . These networks linked closely to USDA and its legacy of scientific collaboration across US states that together with the Foundations strongly influenced the design of the first two international centers for the major cereals . In Latin America the various efforts by the US National Academy of Sciences the US government and the countries of the region resulted in the creation of three centers for tropical agriculture with a broader research focus on farming systems and natural resources . Finally we show how the establishment of four IARCs in Africa in different ways drew on a colonial legacy that had moved toward centralization of research across colonial territories since before WWII . All of these efforts over many decades involved a good deal of experimentation in organization funding and governance to arrive at the standard IARC model that emerged . By the late 1960s the genesis of another six IARCs was already in place stimulating the creation of the CGIAR to fund and coordinate the IARCs . The review concludes with a brief reflection on the successes and challenges of the IARC model over 50years and its relevance today .",
        "Highlights":"The CGIAR was created in 1971 and the IARCs became a major institutional innovation for development assistance. The invention of the IARC has been attributed to US Foundations starting in Mexico in 1943. This review uses new sources to identify the role of many other actors in developing the IARC model starting from the 1920s. The IARCs inherited a proven model of crop research but have struggled with a model and stable funding for NRM. Core elements of the IARC model remain relevant today but require further evolution especially integration as a system."

Yet the mounting financial burden faced by all countries means that additional support is unlikely to be forthcoming in the near future . It is critical that developing countries find innovative policy mechanisms to achieve sustainability and development aims in a cost effective manner . This requires identifying affordable policies that can yield immediate progress towards several SDGs together and aligns economic incentives for longer term sustainable development . We identify three policies that meet these criteria a fossil fuel subsidy swap to fund clean energy investments and dissemination of renewable energy in rural areas reallocating irrigation subsidies to improve water supply sanitation and wastewater infrastructure and a tropical carbon tax which is a levy on fossil fuels that funds natural climate solutions . Such innovative and cost effective policy mechanisms do not require substantial external support and they foster greater progress towards achieving the SDGs in poorer economies .",

Building on analytical insights from the political settlements and state fragility literature conceptualising peacebuilding processes as efforts to forge social contracts enables us to address the roles of governments social groups citizens and external stakeholders . We discuss the potential for peacebuilding processes to realise social contracts by assessing societal perceptions of the core public good that citizens expect the state to provide namely protection . We address two cases where stateness was destroyed by foreign intervention and civil war Iraq and Libya . We discuss the troubled recent trajectories of efforts to build peace in Iraq and Libya along the substantive spatial and temporal dimensions of the social contract . Drawing on interviews survey results and estimates of civilian casualties we take a bottom up perspective of their societies experiences and expectations regarding protection . We conclude that in both countries the provision of protection by the state and others runs counter to the expectations of significant parts of the population . At the national level major social groups have been unable to overcome mutual distrust while continued threats to physical security reduce the prospects that any social contract able to deliver other public goods can ever emerge . Existing political settlements in both countries have rewarded the politicization of ethno sectarian identity and have benefited economic war lordism .

Cambodias microfinance sector is one of the fastest growing and like others in the Global South has moved from offering entrepreneurial capital to everyday liquidity and even disaster relief . In this Viewpoint however we argue that the promotion of microfinance as market based relief and recovery from the pandemic should be a source of concern not comfort . We firstly suggest that as a result of the health and economic impacts associated with COVID 19 credit taking is likely to escalate further in terms of the number of borrowers and loan amounts . Second we contend that a growing reliance on MFIs will leave households undernourished and further vulnerable to its disciplining and extractive impulses . Third we argue that the interplay between over indebtedness pre existing malnutrition challenges and the global public health crisis of COVID 19 represents a major challenge to gender equality and sustainable development . Coordination between the Cambodian government microfinance lenders international investors and development partners is vital to offer debt relief .

By analyzing resettlement villages in Yunnan Province we first explore the complex ways in which local governments implemented one specific participatory approach namely the right for dam resettlers to choose between self or government organized resettlement . We examine the reactions and specific responses of dam migrants to this participatory approach and probe how this right to choose testifies to political rationalities that convey a narrow understanding of participation and shift responsibility for resettlement outcomes from the state to households . Secondly we highlight the ways in which migrant households navigate the new participatory approach and its impacts on post resettlement livelihoods . We notably highlight how the right to choose reshuffled pre resettlement social and power relations between local authorities and self and government resettlers . Our study demonstrates first that in Chinas socialist governmentality participatory approaches create liberal and socialist dam migrant subjectivities . The former cope with various disincentives and are successfully responsibilized and turned into obedient subjects . The latter are incentivized to be obedient and responsible but instead frequently challenge the local state . Second households which have decided to self organize their resettlement in line with liberal rationalities are socially and economically marginalized regardless of their earlier social status . By applying a governmentality analytics this study thus provides a nuanced picture of processes of marginalization and contestation in the course of dam induced resettlement . Instead of running along the lines of rich and poor marginalization through participation cuts across the economic divide and can better be explained by differentiating between liberal and socialist subjects .",

Several studies analyzed effects of contracts on smallholder productivity and income with mixed results . Most existing studies focused on one particular contract scheme . Contract characteristics rarely differ within one scheme so little is known about how different contract characteristics may influence the benefits for smallholders . Here we address this research gap using data from oil palm farmers in Ghana who participate in different contract schemes . Some of the farmers have simple marketing contracts while others have resource providing contracts where the buyer also offers inputs and technical services on credit . A comparison group cultivates oil palm without any contract . Regression models that control for selection bias show that resource providing contracts increase farmers input use and yield . Resource providing contracts also incentivize higher levels of specialization and an increase in the scale of production . These effects are especially pronounced for small and medium sized farms . In contrast the marketing contracts have no significant effects on input use productivity and scale of production .

In contrast in societies with a more equal distribution of opportunities an increase in income inequality can be more easily reversed and need not constrain investment opportunities and growth . We identify equality of opportunity with intergenerational mobility that is the degree of the correlation between parents attainments and childrens attainments . We use several recently developed internationally comparable measures of intergenerational mobilityincluding the World Banks comprehensive GDIM databaseto confirm that the negative impact of income inequality on growth is higher the lower is intergenerational mobility .

        "Abstract":"One of the immediate responses to COVID 19 has been a call to ban wildlife trade given the suspected origin of the pandemic in a Chinese market selling and butchering wild animals . There is clearly an urgent need to tackle wildlife trade that is illegal unsustainable or carries major risks to human health biodiversity conservation or meeting acceptable animal welfare standards . However some of the suggested actions in these calls go far beyond tackling these risks and have the potential to undermine human rights damage conservation incentives and harm sustainable development . There are a number of reasons for this concerns . First calls for bans on wildlife markets often include calls for bans on wet markets but the two are not the same thing and wet markets can be a critical underpinning of informal food systems . Second wildlife trade generates essential resources for the worlds most vulnerable people contributing to food security for millions of people particularly in developing countries . Third wildlife trade bans have conservation risks including driving trade underground making it even harder to regulate and encouraging further livestock production . Fourth in many cases sustainable wildlife trade can provide key incentives for local people to actively protect species and the habitat they depend on leading to population recoveries . Most importantly a singular focus on wildlife trade overlooks the key driver of the emergence of infectious diseases habitat destruction largely driven by agricultural expansion and deforestation and industrial livestock production . We suggest that the COVID 19 crisis provides a unique opportunity for a paradigm shift both in our global food system and also in our approach to conservation . We make specific suggestions as to what this entails but the overriding principle is that local people must be at the heart of such policy shifts .",
        "Highlights":"Calls to ban wildlife trade have been a key response to COVID 19 but are not the solution. The major drivers of the emergence of infectious diseases include habitat destruction and industrialised livestock production. Indiscriminate wildlife trade bans risk doing more harm than good both from a conservation and development perspective. Conservation linked responses to COVID 19 need to address the key drivers respect rights and ensure local participation in decision making."

        "Abstract":"Migrant workers play a significant role in the economy of Bangladesh pumping approximately USD15 billion into the economy that directly contributes to the socio economic development of Bangladesh every year . These workers and their dependents are in a socially vulnerable and economically difficult situation due to the dire impacts of the COVID 19 . Migrant workers from Bangladesh in other countries are facing adverse impacts such as unemployment short working hours isolation poor quality of living social discrimination and mental pressure while their dependents at home are facing financial crisis due to the limited or reduced cash flow from their working relatives . A significant number of migrant workers have been sent back to Bangladesh and many are in constant fear of being sent back due to the impacts of COVID 19 in their host countries . Thus COVID 19 intensifies numerous socio economic crises such as joblessness consumption of reserve funds by family members and shrinking of the countrys remittance inflow . In this situation the most urgent and important need is to give financial security and social safety to the workers abroad and those who have returned to Bangladesh . Apart from diplomatic endeavors to maintain the status quo of policy the government of Bangladesh may take initiatives to provide financial support to these workers as a short term strategy to overcome hardships during the pandemic and design a comprehensive plan with a detailed database of all migrant workers to create a need based and skilled workforce as a long term solution . These strategies can mitigate the impacts of COVID 19 at present and address migration related problems in future .",

In 2016 however Burkina Faso announced an abrupt phase out of Bt cotton citing millions of dollars of losses due to inferior lint quality . In hindsight quality issues were conspicuously absent from the success narrative particularly given that cotton sector actors were aware of problems for a decade . Recent data also reveal significantly lower yield gains and substantial inequalities between farmers further questioning the success story and the evaluation literature it relied upon . Why and how was such a faulty and incomplete success narrative produced and promoted To answer this we draw on extended fieldwork conducted over ten years in Burkina Faso to critically examine how the knowledge used to build this success narrative was produced . We first scrutinize the evaluation literature pointing out flaws and blindspots in the methodologies and reporting of findings . We then extend our analysis drawing on political ecology and critical science studies to focus on the power relations of knowledge production . We focus on three themes and show how the political economic context favored the production of positive results with Monsanto holding substantial power over the evaluation process the narrow epistemologies of agronomic evaluation produced apolitical knowledge that overlooked how local level power dynamics shaped data collection and in at least two cases the returns accrued by smaller scale Bt cotton farmers the knowledge produced via these processes was used to accrue material benefits to Monsanto and helped to promote GM crops across the continent . We conclude that future GM crop evaluations should be more self reflexive critical and transparent in how power shapes the evaluation process and agricultural outcomes for differentiated farmers .",

But their poorer situation may also be linked to worse public service delivery . Relying on large household surveys in rural Ethiopia we explore this by assessing the association of two measures of remoteness the distance of service centers to district capitals and the distance of households to service centers with public service delivery in agriculture and health sectors . In the agriculture sector we document statistically significant and economically meaningful associations between exposure to agriculture extension and the two measures of remoteness . For health extension only the last mile matters . These differences between the two sectors could be due to the fact that more remote villages tend to have fewer agriculture extension workers who also put in fewer hours than their peers in more connected areas . This does not apply in the health sector . These findings provide valuable inputs for policymakers aiming to improve inclusiveness in poor rural areas .",

However there is a lack of empirical evidence on how patterns of time use translate into patterns of physical activity and energy expenditure particularly in rural areas where seasonal agricultural labour plays such an important role . We address this gap by integrating energy expenditure data derived from wearable tri axial accelerometers with time use data from conventional recall based surveys . Using datasets from agricultural households in four rural communities in India and Nepal our results show that there are significant gender differences in the patterns of time use and energy expenditure . Men and women participate equally in productive work however women shoulder most of the additional reproductive work burdens in rural households at the expense of leisure opportunities .

For the range of activities observed productive work has significantly larger energy shares than time shares for both men and women. Men and women participate equally in productive work but women shoulder most of the reproductive work at the expense of leisure opportunities. While time use may not be a reliable indicator of work burden results reveal some of the trade offs women face in performing competing tasks."

The World Bank estimates that recurring operations and maintenance costs for basic water and sanitation services will rise from about 4 billion to over 30 billion per year by 2030 significantly outweighing capital costs for basic WASH services . Yet available funding from regional national and international sources regularly prioritizes capital investment in new water infrastructure leading to significant unfunded operation and maintenance mandates for service providers operating in low income settings where consumer payments can not practically cover operating costs . Capital maintenance is deferred leading to poor utility financial performance and decreased service for water customers . In this paper we present indicative funding models valuation of existing assets and expenditures of four medium sized urban water utilities in low middle and high income communities representing a broad range of operating contexts . Yet we find common operating challenges . None of the four utilities are spending enough on capital maintenance to sustain service levels and we find that the gap between the life cycle costs of water service delivery and associated revenues of water services ranges from 1 to 17 per customer each year . Discounting life cycle costs by service and coverage levels further widens the funding gap . All utilities would need additional funding to reach universal access with full coverage of life cycle costs ranging from 6 of budgets to nearly 8 times current funding levels . This would not be economically or politically feasible through tariffs alone which are already currently subsidized in all contexts . The contribution of progressive tax monies to subsidize services is taken for granted in high income contexts and unavailable in poorer ones that must rely on insufficient and irregular foreign aid or national budget allocations in strained economies . These findings contrast with a commonly shared view in the global development sector that local or at minimum regional financial sustainability of water supplies is achievable . Consequently our findings suggest that national governments and international donors should acknowledge that long term support of local water service delivery is both necessary appropriate and likely more cost effective than current funding models .",

All utilities have budget gaps from 2.6 to 10 000. Tariffs comprise 41 of revenue in Boulder and 82100 in the lower income cases.

Since older people are exposed to much higher death risks older populations are expected to face much more difficult challenges coping with the pandemic . The urban rural dimension turns out to be very important as the remote rural areas are also the oldest . In the map NUTS 3 regions of Europe are colored according to the deviation from European pooled estimate of the proportion of population at risk of death due to COVID 19 . We assume that 5 6 of the populations get infected and experience age specific infection fatality ratios modelled by the Imperial College COVID 19 Response Team . We adjust IFRs by sex ratios of age specific case fatality ratios observed in the European countries that are included in the COVerAGE DB . Thus we effectively introduce a summary measure of population age structures focused on the most vulnerable to the pandemic . Such an estimate for the total European population is 1 . The map reflects the unequal population age structures rather than the precise figures on COVID 19 fatality . It is a case if scenario that highlights the possible effect of the population age structures a demographic perspective .

Results showed that fat was the important reservoir for aroma compounds in the emulsion . The particle sizes of emulsions significantly decreased with prolonged stewing time of gelatin which was consistent with the results from confocal laser scanning microscopy and interfacial tension . The ability of pre heated gelatin emulsions to bind volatile compounds with higher hydrophobicity was enhanced . When 0.1 gelatin was added into chicken broth the total amount of the main volatile compounds increased from 458.83ng g to 1218.42ng g. In summary the pre heated gelatin increased the interfacial pressure of water oil interface resulting in a smaller particle size of oil droplets and these further increased the binding area between oil droplets and flavor compounds .

        "Abstract":"It has been hypothesised that deficits in the functions of predictive motor control and internal modeling may contribute to motor control issues of children with Developmental Coordination Disorder . Virtual reality technologies have great potential to provide opportunity for Motor observation and motor imagery which could enhance learning and development of motor skills in children with DCD . Thus the present study aimed to investigate the benefits of a VR training intervention to improve predictive motor control functions of children with DCD . Forty female children with DCD were randomly assigned to VR and control groups . In this study an experimental pre post and follow up design was used and Predictive motor control functions were measured before and after the VR intervention and two months later . Predictive motor control was evaluated using MI action planning and rapid and online control tests . VR intervention consisted of a selection of Xbox 360 Kinect games that were performed for sixteen 30 min sessions over 8 weeks . Compared to the control group the VR group improved significantly on measures of MI motor planning and rapid and online control scores from pre to post test and retained their performance to follow up . Overall it seems that virtual reality training program may be used as an appropriate intervention approach for developing the ability of MI and predictive motor control functions in DCD children .",
        "Highlights":"First study of the application of virtual reality VR training for predictive motor control in DCD children. Results are consistent with the hypothesis of the developmental delay of internal modeling in DCD children. Predictive motor control functions of DCD children improved after VR training intervention. VR interventions may be useful to optimize motor skills in those with DCD."

        "Abstract":"The dual task paradigm is an ecologically valid approach to assess cognitive function in relation with motor demands particularly for children with Down syndrome . This study aimed to determine DT performance for a complex Change of Direction walking task in children with DS . The sample included 12 children with DS 12 typically developing children matched for chronological and 12 TD children matched for mental age . We examined DT performance with the Trail Walking Test participants walked along a fixed pathway following a prescribed path delineated by target markers of increasing sequential numbers and increasing sequential numbers and letters . Motor and cognitive dual task costs were calculated . For the TWT an ANOVA with repeated measures revealed significant differences between DS and the CA but not the MA group . Overall there were significant decreases in speed with increasing cognitive demands . In addition all children produced higher cognitive compared to motor DTC which were more pronounced in the cognitively more challenging condition . The assessment of motor and cognitive performance in a DT paradigm provided insight in how motor and or cognitive impairment constrains the ability of children to successfully perform activities in a complex and dynamical environment .",
        "Highlights":"The single task condition of walking is a challenge for children with DS. DS children show reduced attention and cognitive ressources when performing DT. TD children show a positive developmental trend in attention resources. Walking with Change of Direction represents a reliable DT paradigm. Visual search while walking seems to be a major challenge for children with DS."

It focusses on children with dyslexia developmental language disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism . In general studies show that arithmetical weaknesses are commoner in children with any of these disorders than in controls . Autism is sometimes associated with specific strengths in arithmetic but even in autism it is commoner for arithmetic to be a relative weakness than a relative strength . There may be some genetic reasons why there is an overlap between mathematical difficulties and other developmental learning difficulties but much of the reason seems to be that specific aspects of arithmetic are often influenced by other factors including language comprehension phonological awareness verbal and spatial working memory and long term memory and executive functions . The findings discussed here will be discussed in relation to Penningtons Multiple Deficit Model .",
        "Highlights":"Dyslexia and developmental language disorder are frequently associated with deficits in those aspects of arithmetic associated with verbal memory long term memory e.g. multiplication tables or working memory. Autism may be associated with specific strengths in arithmetic but is more often associated with specific weaknesses in arithmetic. Attention deficits but not hyperactivity are associated with arithmetical difficulties. Arithmetic is associated with so called domain general executive functions but it may be that some numerical abilities are a form of executive function. The findings reviewed here give considerable support for Pennington 2006 Multiple Deficit Model of comorbidity."

In addition executive function deficits as well as diminished language capacity and vocabulary have been consistently demonstrated in individuals with ASD . The primary purpose of this study was to create a model to understand how these constructs interact in children with ASD . Forty six children diagnosed with ASD along with their parents and teachers participated . All children completed standardized vocabulary testing . For each child one parent and one teacher completed executive function and systemizing scales . For parents and teachers systemizing was significantly associated with vocabulary . For parents systematizing was significantly associated with all executive function subscales however for teachers systemizing was only significantly associated with half of the executive function subscales . The mediation model indicated that the relationship between vocabulary and systemizing was fully mediated by executive function for parents but the model was not significant for teachers . This model demonstrates that systemizing vocabulary and executive function should not be studied in isolation when attempting to understand the behaviors of children with ASD and can help us to better plan educational and therapeutic interventions .",

This study investigated the effects of DLD and bilingualism on childrens EF development . Monolingual and bilingual children with DLD and typical development TD Monolinguals and bilinguals with DLD had weak working memory and inhibition skills at each time point compared to TD peers which could partly be explained by verbal short term memory limitations . Positive effects of bilingualism emerged when controlling for Dutch vocabulary and morphology skills and were most pronounced at time 1 . Monolinguals and bilinguals with DLD have similar and persistent EF deficits which are partly secondary to verbal short term memory weaknesses . Bilinguals performed better on EF than monolinguals when Dutch language knowledge was controlled for . This effect was found regardless of DLD and was most prominent at age 56 years .",

However without mandated policies or procedures in place for transition planning in Australia students with autism will continue to be minimally engaged or completely disengaged from the transition planning process in schools . This is likely to significantly impact post school outcomes for these students . While previous studies have investigated the extent of student involvement in their IEP transition planning meetings none of these studies considered the views of students with autism despite research suggesting that children are experts of their own experiences and their own lives . The aim of the current study was to determine how involved students with autism were in the transition planning process . Interviews were conducted with 18 students with autism aged 1518 years . Interviews were analysed using inductive content analysis . The results revealed that students lacked knowledge of the transition planning process however many students expressed the desire to be significantly involved in the process . The majority of students reported that they only contributed minimally during meetings . Numerous students reported being unaware of existing transition practices that were in place for them .

The confinement of the population and the outbreak impact on health care systems disrupted the routine care for non COVID 19 patients . Particular challenges have been faced for services working with neurodevelopmental disabilities and pediatric neurological disorders . We present the adaptation of our Child Neurology and Developmental Neuropsychology Service at the Developmental Neurology Unit which is responsible for cognitive and behavioral assessment of children with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological diseases on an inpatient outpatient basis to the epidemic outbreak . In particular we describe the introduction of telehealth in clinical practice and provide qualitative and quantitative data regarding the feasibility of the telemedicine protocol and the level of satisfaction experienced by families . Patients admitted on an inpatient basis are limited to non deferrable cases all patients do pre admission screening to exclude COVID 19 infection . Child neurologists and psychologists have switched the out patient visits to telemedicine sessions despite they had little to no previous experience in telemedicine . Families response to the proposal of video sessions has been positive with 93 of families accepting it preparing appropriate devices and conditions to participate at home . Main barriers to tele sessions access were socio economic and linguistic disadvantage together with familiar health issues . The Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire revealed high level of agreementi between expected care and actual care received by patients and caregivers .

Given this trend it is essential that the influence of contextual variables on emotion are investigated . The present study contributes to the discussion with an investigation of the effect of social context on implicit emotional responses to food images . 87 participants viewed food images of varying acceptability either alone with a stranger or with a friend . Subjective liking ratings were measured using a labelled affective magnitude scale and facial muscle activity from zygomaticus major corrugator supercilii and levator labii superioris were measured with an EMG recording system . Controlling for individual differences in facial expressivity and food image acceptability using linear mixed models it was found that the presence of a co acting stranger facilitated muscle activity indicative of a disgust response increased the strength of relationship between muscle activity and subjective liking ratings and led to lower subjective liking overall . No differences in muscle activity or subjective liking were found between subjects who participated alone and with a co acting friend . This suggests that the influence of social context is complex where the relationship between the subject and the social environment can impact both hedonic and emotional evaluations of food stimuli . These findings indicate that facial EMG can be a useful dynamic and implicit measure of emotion in consumer research but it is critical to consider the social context of the testing environment .",

Accordingly the present study examined the feeding practices of grandparents who report providing childcare to their grandchildren developed and tested a model linking the various practices of grandparent caregivers to the frequency with which their grandchildren consume healthy and unhealthy foods while in grandparental care and explored the socio demographic predictors of engagement in feeding practices . An online survey was administered to grandparents who reported providing regular care to at least one grandchild aged 314years",
        "Highlights":"Grandparents have the potential to shape the eating behaviours of their grandchildren. Research on grandparents feeding practices and grandchild diet quality is lacking. Positive practices were more important to diet quality than negative practices. Providing a healthy food environment and setting limits were especially important. Grandparents should be considered stakeholders in the promotion of healthy eating."

        "Abstract":"Recent studies have pointed out some cross modal correspondences between flavoured beverages as well as basic taste solutions and specific geometric visual cues . Some of them associate known drink tastes to shapes of receptacles . In particular sweetness is associated with curved receptacles and bitterness with sharp angled ones . Our study aimed to test the hypothesis according to which near threshold solutions might also activate this cross modal correspondence . We used two different cup forms one curved and the other sharp angled with pure sweet and bitter solutions just above sensorial thresholds . We designed two tasks using a two alternative forced choice test . Participants had to decide which drink was sweeter Task 1 and bitterer Task 2 from the curved and sharp angled cups . Results showed the cross modal correspondence but only when participants drank first from the curved cup and second from the sharp angled cup . The effect disappeared when participants drank first from the sharp angled cup and second from the curved cup . This suggests that the correspondence emerges using sweet and bitter near threshold solutions in specific conditions . On the other hand results also showed that confidence level of responses was significantly higher in the bitter task than in the sweet task . We discuss these complex results in the light of different theoretical proposals to explain this cross modal correspondence .",

        "Abstract":"Immersive technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality have been recently explored in the field of food consumption studies from different perspectives . The present study utilized virtual reality technology in a within subject experiment with three conditions to examine whether a varying virtual eating environment can alter consumers emotional responses to the eating situation and whether the resulting emotional responses correlate with consumers wanting liking and hedonic evaluations of healthy and unhealthy snacks . In addition the study analyzed whether a virtual eating environment that generates a positive emotional response can raise consumers rating of a healthy snack to the same level as an unhealthy snack consumed in a plain unimmersed environment . The results showed a correlation between positive emotional responses and the pre tasting evaluations of both snacks . In terms of hedonic evaluations positive emotional responses correlated mainly with consumers evaluation of the unhealthy snack . When pre tasting wanting and liking evaluations are compared between experimental conditions the results indicate that a healthy snack is rated higher in a virtual reality environment that induces a more positive emotional response . The healthy snack was also rated at the same level as the unhealthy snack consumed in a plain environment . No differences between conditions were observed in consumers hedonic evaluations of the products . EEG and heart rate measurement results indicate that this might be because tasting a healthy snack generates more cognitive processing than an unhealthy snack . This might reduce the influence of the virtual eating environment on consumers evaluations . To conclude virtual reality technologies might have the potential to support consumers eating experiences and healthy food choices by improving their evaluations of the products .",

In this research we investigate whether package labels featuring the word surprise influence food portion size choice of hedonic snacks . Surprise appeals are used frequently by the food industry to encourage product choice but their effect on portion size choice is not yet well understood . In four experimental studies we investigate the effect of surprise labelswithout changing the level of information about the producton food portion size choice . We consistently find that surprise labels compared to conventional labels increase food portion size choice . We furthermore show that this effect is driven by an increase in anticipated enjoyment associated with the surprise labeled snack . Theoretically our findings contribute to literature on the implications of the halo effect in food portion size choice by showing that a surprise label triggers a positive halo effect and thereby increases portion size choice .",

Such measures were designed to go beyond liking and better understand how the actual product with or without a context could elicit positive of negative emotions that help inform overall product performance . Products can be optimised according to their emotions profile as well as their sensory profile and such information is valuable from a marketing point of view as it opens new doors for advertising claims etc . What needs further investigation is how relevant and how valid this information is . In recent studies it was argued that emotional responses are not so much driven by the samples themselves but by the context gravitating around the samples and around the assessors .",

Using wine consumers we tested the concept of a two dimensional labelled map to identify an innovative product and determined the level of difficulty in using a map scale .. The RPM method highlighted innovative wine styles those wines that were simultaneously liked and considered different to a reference . Liking results from the RPM method were similar to results from the traditional 9 point hedonic scale providing validity for the preference component of the new method . RPM conveniently and simultaneously identifies preferred and innovative wine styles in a 2D product map a unique contribution that no other scale is capable of achieving .",

This study aimed to determine whether hand feel touch cues of cup sleeve materials could be associated with imagined and consumed basic tastes and thereby affect the perception of brewed coffee . Participants were asked to evaluate twelve different cup sleeve materials with respect to evoked emotions and their degree of matching with each of the four basic taste qualities and brewed coffee related flavor attributes . Individual cup sleeve materials were found to be more associated with specific taste qualities coffee related flavors and emotions . Hand feel touch cues of different sleeves were also found to be associated with taste qualities consumed . For example towel linen stainless steel and cardboard materials were matched with sweet salty sour and bitter taste qualities respectively . Specific physical characteristics of cup sleeve materials were found to be involved in mediating such cross modal associations between hand feel touch and taste cues . In Study 3 participants were asked to evaluate brewed coffee samples in paper cups both with cardboard sleeves and those made from the other test materials . While participants rated black coffee samples with a towel sleeve less bitter than those with a cardboard sleeve such differences were not observed in other pairwise comparisons . In conclusion this study provided empirical evidence that hand feel touch cues can be associated with specific taste or coffee related flavor attributes thereby modulating consumer perception of brewed coffee .",

The level of meat consumption is unsustainable and a recent study estimates a necessary reduction of 90 of the current intake . Insects are a promising alternative to existing protein sources but previous literature has emphasised the initial level of disgust displayed towards insects as a food option . The overall aim of this paper is to understand the attitude of consumers towards eating insects also termed entomophagy in order to outline the barriers that prevent adoption and provide insights in order to overcome these . Data were collected through an online questionnaire with a representative sample of Danish consumers . Several constructs from the literature were measured food neophobia disgust intention to try and intention to eat regularly . In addition a new attitude scale was used that specifically measures the attitude towards entomophagy . A discrete choice experiment was a part of the questionnaire . Using LatentGold 5.1 a segmentation analysis based on the choice experiment was conducted . The influences of intention were analysed using hierarchical regression in SPSS 25 . Results of the choice experiment indicate that different segments of consumers of entomophagy exist and that different segments are interested in different types of insects . Younger consumers and males are more positive towards entomophagy in general and the insect options in the choice experiment . Results of the regression analysis indicate that the attitude toward eating insects is multidimensional and that there seem to be indications of attitude ambivalence in all segments . The interest in entomophagy is important as it will be a key factor in overcoming the barrier of disgust and turning insects into an acceptable food choice in the Western world .",

        "Abstract":"Craft beer is a product category that continues to expand and craft beer drinkers are generally differentiated from traditional beer drinkers in terms of their preference for innovative beers with novel and complex flavor profiles and greater involvement in beer and product focused behaviors and activities . The present research explores the existence of flavor driven segments within the overall craft beer segment where some declared craft beer drinkers exhibit the characteristic craft beer preference while others exhibit a preference for less complex and more traditional flavors . Research conducted with craft style and traditional style beers confirmed such preference segments in a group of male New Zealanders . The preference segments perceived the sensory and holistic conceptual characteristics of the beers similarly . However they differed in specific attitudes and behaviors toward craft beers that were associated with the extent of their use and exposure to craft beers . The presence of the two preference segments was interpreted as being the result of a normal transition of declared craft beer drinker preferences away from the lighter flavors of the traditional style beers to which they had been accustomed and toward the more novel and robust flavors of craft beers . This shift in flavor preferences is tentatively attributed to the same exposure effects that are responsible for flavor preference development in other foods and beverages . The implications for craft and traditional brewers are discussed and suggestions for future research presented .",

This table is most often analysed using correspondence analysis . CA aims at decomposing dependence between products and descriptors into axes of maximal and decreasing dependencies which is reasonable if the dependence has been previously established by a chi square test . However the p value of this test is not valid when the observations are not independent or when the contingency table contains too many low expected citation rates . In addition rejecting independence with a chi square test only means that at least the first CA axis captures some dependence . This paper presents a test to determine the number of axes of the CA that capture significant dependence and proposes a Monte Carlo approach to compute valid p values for this test . The variability in the products coordinates in the CA space is often evaluated by means of a total bootstrap procedure . The paper proposes to rely on this test to determine the number of axes to consider for the Procrustes rotations of such a procedure . Finally to investigate which words are cited more often for each product the paper proposes performing Fishers exact tests per cell on the derived contingency table obtained by reversing the CA computations on the axes capturing significant dependence . The benefits of accounting for the dimensionality of the dependence in the analyses are demonstrated on real CATA data .",

Studies have identified preference for local foods as an emergent consumer ideology called locavorism but they have not yet addressed its antecedents or put it into a theoretical context . In addition extant research provides several insights into local food buying behaviour in developed economies however studies simultaneously conducted in developed and emerging economies are lacking . To address these research gaps this study develops a conceptual framework with proposed relationships among values beliefs and attitudes towards and intentions to purchase local foods in China and Denmark . We conducted an online survey in China and Denmark that evaluated our constructs with pre developed multiple item measures . Using structural equation modelling to test the integrated model we find that values and long term orientation are antecedents of consumer beliefs but the influences of values on consumer beliefs differ between collectivistic dominated China and individualistic dominated Denmark . Specifically collectivistic values are significantly and positively related to locavorism in both countries while individualistic values are strongly linked to locavorism only in Denmark collectivistic values have no effects on fresh start mindset for the two samples but individualistic values are significantly and positively related to a fresh start mindset in Denmark .

To achieve this consumer preferences were decomposed in conditions of full access to information and data was compared with actual consumer behaviour related to making purchasing decisions in front of the store shelf . Based on data from 338 respondents conjoint analysis and repeated ANOVA measurements were carried out allowing to eliminate individual behavioural patterns . The results showed a dissonance between the consumers attitudes towards the attributes and their shopping behaviour . The processing method was the most important declared attribute for consumers meanwhile this information was the least searched for during purchase . At the same time shelf life period marked as the least important was the main information searched for by consumers when shopping . The results also show a clear dislike towards the use of microwaves as a preservation method while traditional thermal preservation was marked as the most positive for consumers . In addition consumers were classified into 3 heterogeneous groups identifying differences in the preferences of food attributes . The obtained results have practical value relating not only to the preferences of individual attributes but also to their various variants . The results can be a guide for companies to properly label food products .

The present experiment investigated whether this attentional bias can be influenced by context variables and changes over time . This was studied via time course analysis . Ninety women were presented with 60 picture pairs that either showed a combination of high calorie food low calorie food high calorie food non food or low calorie food non food . The women were assigned to one of three groups overweight with weight concerns normal weight with weight concerns normal weight without weight concerns . The relative number of fixations on food cues was examined across the course of the picture pair presentations for one second intervals . High calorie food was fixated more often than low calorie food and non food only during the first second of the picture pair presentation . Subsequently all participants showed the tendency to gaze on low calorie cues when these cues were combined with high calorie cues . This study revealed timing related context effects on visual food cue reactivity .

The study employed image visualization metrics based on experiments using the eye tracking instrument . The methodological part was divided into two stages . The first was based on a Discrete Choice model obtaining the following probabilities of the consumer choosing the product 2.52 8.5 4.3 2.43 and 5.2 for an increase in self esteem for the male gender for the presence of an organic seal for the presence of a transgenic seal and for the presence of a seal that represents a large property respectively . The second stage was based on hypothesis tests as a complementary methodology to the first stage . In this context the time metrics total fixation of look on the product and time of first fixation on the product for the organic vs. transgenic seals did not differ for individuals classified as having low self esteem and in individuals of the male gender . As for women and for individuals with high self esteem these metrics were lower in the visualizations of an organic seal compared to the transgenic ones .

        "Abstract":"Many people implicitly believe that unhealthy foods are tastier than healthy foods even when they explicitly report that they dont . It is unclear whether this unhealthy tasty intuition is already present in childhood . Children from families with a lower socioeconomic position consume poorer diets than children from families with a higher SEP. Paradoxically populations with a lower SEP are underrepresented in research and least reached by lifestyle interventions . This study explored implicit and explicit associations between healthiness tastiness and liking of foods in primary school aged children and parents with a lower SEP .",

Data were collected at two laboratory sessions during which children and mothers were separately asked to choose two food items for a midafternoon snack first for themselves and then for the other dyad member . Participants also rated their liking and perceived healthiness of the 10 food items . After T1 dyads were randomly assigned to an experimental group with an in home pleasure oriented intervention to stimulate the pleasure of consuming healthy foods or to a control group . Our study shows the lack of a significant effect of the intervention on the nutritional quality of snacks chosen at T2 . However for the children in the experimental group the relationship between liking and perceived healthiness which was not significant at T1",

        "Abstract":"Front of Pack nutrition labels are emerging as a prominent public policy tool for promoting healthy eating . In this study we question how different FoP nutrition labels ranging from more directive to semi directive and non directive affect perceived visual attention and nutritional quality perception . The visual attention was measured by eye tracing measures and nutritional quality by healthiness perception and recommended frequency of consumption . Seventy six participants were randomly assigned in one of three experimental conditions where they were asked to give estimates on eight different chocolate snack bars . To test whether participants estimates were accurate we surveyed fifty six nutritionists and asked for their assessments of the same group of products . The results showed that Nutriscore required least visual attention in terms of dwell time number of fixations and average fixation duration followed by MTL and GDA . Participants in NS and MTL condition gave significantly higher estimates of nutritional quality compared to experts estimates . Most accurate estimates came from products with GDA label . Color coded fields required less visual attention compared to GDA without adding to visual efficiency . More directive FoP nutrition labels require less visual attention but lead to inflated estimates of products nutrition quality in the category of less healthy products . In creating public policies removing the possibility for consumers to process nutritional information and absolute estimates of products nutrition quality should not be disregarded .",

Questionnaires were administered to 187 different sex couples in Denmark . Both members of the couple reported their degree of agreement with a set of statements regarding meal production focus and the SWFRL scale . Using the APIM and structural equation modeling we found that the womans SWFRL was positively associated with her own focus on taste in meal production as wells as by her partners focus on taste . Womens SWFRL was also positively associated with their own focus on physical context in meal production and negatively by their partners focus on physical context . The mans SWFRL only was positively associated with his own focus on physical context and by his partners focus on thrift in meal production . These results suggest that meal preparation focus relationships between members of a couple through by both actor and partner effects can effectively contribute to increase both their satisfaction with food related life and their well being .",

However there is very little knowledge about consumers reactions towards novel food products made with upcycled ingredients . This manuscript provides the first critical scientific investigation of UK consumers preferences for novel food products made with upcycled ingredients using four attributes price flour protein and Carbon Trust label . Using a hypothetical ranking experiment involving biscuits results showed that consumers prefer biscuits made with conventional flour and tend to reject biscuits made with upcycled sunflower flour . Results suggest there is heterogeneity in consumers valuation with three groups identified the first group with price sensitive consumers and the strongest preferences for low price biscuits the second group with traditionalist consumers and strongest rejection for upcycled sunflower flour the third group with environmentalist consumers and the strongest preference for biscuits with the Carbon Trust label . Most consumers had not heard of upcycled ingredients before but they would consider buying foods with upcycled ingredients . These findings provide insights into the psychology of consumers preferences which can be used to most effectively communicate the benefits of upcycled ingredients to the public . This will also have important implications for future labelling strategies for policy makers providing valuable insights to upcycled food products manufacturers .",

This investigation presents a systematic literature review of studies performed in the last 20years that use DCEs to analyse consumers preferences for finfish products with the purpose to identify the main insights of consumer behaviour towards these products the most used attributes for this type of experiments and to discuss and compare some willingness to pay estimations . We found that origin was the most used attribute for this kind of experiments while other important factors were the harvest method a specific certification label and the species or products considered . The WTP estimates evidenced that consumers are willing to pay premiums for domestic products while similarly wild products were preferred over farmed products . Also there were higher WTP estimates for certified products in which specific certification labels were better options rather than just claiming that the product was certified or not . All claims and labels related to sustainability nutritional health and safety information provided premiums that consumers were willing to pay however the importance differed depending on the type of label or claim the country and species . Future research should consider the influence of being or not the main purchaser in the household as it might affect the WTP values . Also given the importance future research extensions using DCEs are needed on the Chinese and Asian finfish market .",

The present study was aimed to explore the appropriateness of emojis to describe pre adolescents emotions elicited by foods recalled in relation to different evoked eating contexts and to explore related age and gender differences . Fifty five boys and forty one girls aged 913 participated to the study . First subjects were asked to recall by means of an open ended question the foods they had in specific eating contexts Most liked food and Most disliked food Breakfast Dinner Snack Birthday and Novel food . Then they were asked to select the emojis appropriate to describe their feelings for the context related foods by selecting from a list of 92 facial emojis . Emojis selected by more than 20 of children in at least one eating context qualified as food related . In total 46 emojis resulted as appropriate to describe emotions in different eating contexts . Pre adolescents used mainly positive emojis except for the context Most disliked food where mainly negative emojis were used . Most food related emojis resulted from Most liked food and Most disliked food but the context Birthday also added some context specific emojis . The number of selected emojis varied across evoked eating contexts eliciting different foods . Age and gender significantly affected emoji selection across and within foods elicited by varied eating contexts with girls and 911 year old subjects selecting some emojis more frequently across all contexts but also within contexts . The approach used in the present study has the potential to be used for the development of a food related emotion measurement tool for pre adolescents . Future research aimed at interpreting the meaning of facial emojis is needed and should consider age and gender differences .",

In the Pack alone scenario similar emotional spaces and sample configurations were obtained with both images and words . In the Pack and tasting scenario the richness of the emotional response increased when using images . In both scenarios the participants used a greater number of negative emotions when these were presented as images rather than as words . This could be considered an advantage as it enables some negative emotional loads to be portrayed . The present results also demonstrate that evaluating the emotional response allows effective discrimination between samples with similar overall liking scores .",

        "Abstract":"As tasting is a dynamic process temporal data are collected simultaneously with tasting . Indeed most newly reported studies involving consumers have been conducted using the Temporal Dominance of Sensations or Temporal Check That Apply methods . Concurrent data collection reduces potential bias such as memory but it attaches great importance to the moment at which the sensations are cited . Thus it results in measurement of durations possibly made imprecise due to heterogeneity in consumers behaviour which could affect conclusions . A new retrospective method inspired from Temporal Order of Sensations Pick 3 and Rank and the 3 phases of wine evaluation is introduced in this article . Based on a concept close to dominance the Attack Evolution Finish method allows consumers to select one descriptor each at the beginning at the middle and at the end of the tasting . The results obtained with two different panels carrying out both the AEF and TDS tasks on dark chocolates are compared . The conclusions are very similar in terms of product discrimination . The retrospective task removes the consumers heterogeneity in terms of the number of citations delays and durations and thus requires no data transformation before analyses . In view of these results rather than promoting a new method the article raises questions about the level of detail to look at in temporal sensory data .",

However the soundness of this theory in the field of food and beverages has been challenged . The work reported here investigates the influence of perceived complexity on consumers preferences for some dairy desserts . Given the limits on sensory complexity reported in the literature we controlled for consumers level of familiarity with the products used enough products to be able to test a quadratic model evaluated sensory complexity with consumers and analyzed data after clustering . Seven gourmet dairy desserts were tested by 145 French consumers unfamiliar with this type of product in a quantitative study . Products were also sensory characterized by a panel using an adaptation of Sequential Profiling . We distinguished four groups of consumers with different perceptions of sensory complexity . For one group the influence of complexity on preference was in line with Berlynes theory . Individual differences were also underlined between groups as the self reported eating style and the level of familiarity with dairy products . Finally our results confirm the importance of a dynamic evaluation to understand sensory complexity . Indeed our findings show the influence of the number of sensations and their temporal evolution on sensory complexity . For the first time we underline the potential effect of texture and flavor sensations on perceived complexity .",

        "Abstract":"Innovations are an important part of the further advancement of societies in general as well as of companies in particular . Individuals can benefit from the advantages of innovations while companies can maintain or increase their market share and profitability . However especially in the food sector scientific or technological innovations often encounter mistrust and rejecting reactions from consumers resulting in decreasing acceptance of those innovations . Therefore this paper aims to gain a deeper comprehension of consumer acceptance of innovative food products as well as to identify antecedent factors of innovation related perception . For the empirical investigation of our conceptualized model an online survey was conducted in Germany and the collected data were analyzed through structural equation modeling . The results confirmed a high predictive power of the multi dimensional model of consumer acceptance . Our first major finding indicates that relative advantage naturalness novelty and discomfort are the most important driving factors of the innovation related perception of food products . Further important findings show that innovation related perception has a strong positive and highly significant impact on customer perceived value respectively a strong negative and highly significant impact on the customer perceived risk . In summary innovation related perception customer perceived value as well as customer perceived risk are all important variables related to the acceptance of an innovative food product . The food sector can benefit from the insights provided by this study to communicate and market their products accordingly to the results to reduce mistrust and increase acceptance of food innovations on the consumer side .",

Food odor exposure has been shown to enhance appetite for food products with similar properties sensory specific appetite . This suggests that based on previous encounters with foods we have learned to detect the nutritional content of foods through our sense of smell . We investigated the influence of aware exposure of macronutrient related odors on various measures of eating behavior in a cross over intervention study . Thirty two normal weight healthy and unrestrained Dutch females took part in five test sessions . On each test session they were exposed to one of five conditions and assessed on specific appetite food preferences and intake . Odor exposure increased congruent appetite after protein related odor exposure . Similarly protein related odor exposure influenced the liking for protein foods and the preference ranking for savory products . However food intake was not affected by smelling congruent food odors . Together this indicates that exposure to food odors may mostly influence appetite but does not impact subsequent food intake . Moreover appetite seems to be triggered by taste qualities rather than macronutrient information of the food as signaled by olfactory cues . Future studies should investigate the role of awareness in more detail to fully understand how odors might be used to steer people towards healthier food choices .",

This oversight may leave organic consumers unaware of the market relevance of wild plant foods . The aim of this study was therefore to understand organic consumers attitudes knowledge and purchasing and gathering practices with respect to wild plant foods and how sociodemographic variables and attitudes can predict knowledge and practices . A purposive sample was drawn from 22 urban and rural food markets across Austria and 497 organic consumers were interviewed using successive freelists and four point Likert scale questions on attitudes . Data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis and multiple linear regressions . Organic consumers knew a median of nine wild food plants and reported five as being gathered and one as being purchased . They valued food quality and the responsible harvest of wild food plants but assigned them a low economic relevance with some respondents sceptical about their suitability as food . Rural residence a higher share of organic consumption and a greater emphasis on responsible harvesting predicted knowledge and gathering of a larger number of plant species . These results confirm that organic consumers know gather and have positive attitudes with respect to wild plant foods although they are hardly aware about their market relevance . We argue that consumers need to be better informed about the wild origin of food ingredients and the added value of organic certification of wild plant foods .",

The term sonic seasoning arising from crossmodal correspondences denotes the tendency for soundtracks with congruent taste flavor attributes to alter peoples food perception . However the implicit behavior effects of such sound taste correspondence have not yet been tested . Employing eye tracking technology the current study explored the influence of custom composed taste congruent soundtracks on visual attention to food and how this audio visual relationship differs across cultures . Seventy two participants were each exposed to three sound conditions while observing different food items in a choice paradigm . Across both cultures participants spent more time fixating on sweet food while listening to sweet music and salty food when listening to salty music while no differences were observed in the no music condition . Danish participants had regardless of sound condition longer fixation times on the food images compared to their Chinese counterparts . Participants choices in each sound condition were consistent with fixation time spent implying a clear congruency effect between music and choice behavior . Our findings provide evidence of how specifically tailored music can guide consumers visual attention to specific food items suggesting that the brain indeed integrates multiple streams of sensory information during decision making . The cross cultural aspect of our study can ultimately be valuable for understanding auditory nudging in different market segments .",

It is not known whether or how dynamic explicit and implicit emotion measures correspond . This study investigated how explicit self reported food evoked emotions evaluated with TDE are related to implicit food evoked emotions determined from facial expressions . Fifty six participants evaluated six yogurts with granola pieces varying in size hardness and concentration using multiple bite assessment employing TDE for the first third and fifth bite of consumption . Consumers were video recorded during each bite of consumption and facial expressions were analysed using FaceReader .",

        "Abstract":"The perception that a food is healthy or low fat has been proposed as an important issue influencing eating behaviour . This study had two aims a to test the perceived health value of two popular foods in Brazil and b to investigate the impact of consuming these foods on subsequent food reward . Individual differences in adiposity and eating behaviour traits were also explored . Twenty four adults were included mean Body Mass Index 27.64.1kg m2 and mean weight 77.414.8kg . They attended the laboratory on two different occasions for Perceived high Fat and perceived Low Fat conditions . Food reward was tested by the LFPQ BR in fasted and fed states for each condition . Two popular food in Brazil were chosen to be used as test meals and were prepared in order to be similar in terms of weight calorie content and macronutrient composition it was hypothesised that Coxinha would be perceived as less healthy and higher fat content than a chicken sandwich . A paper based visual analogue scale was used to confirm this hypothesis . Anthropometric measures and eating behaviour traits scores were undertaken . Results showed that the two nutritionally matched foods differed on several indicators of perceived healthiness including perceived fat content . Post consumption there was an increased implicit wanting for high fat sweet food after the PLF meal . Exploratory analyses showed that cognitive restraint was an independent predictor for the perception of the fat content of PHF and moderated the impact of PHF on implicit wanting . These findings have implications for food marketing and the role of restrained eating on food perception and food reward .",

        "Abstract":"The most common tools to understand perception of food products are hall tests surveys and observations . However these approaches require large samples to get reliable results and they are rather costly and time consuming . Furthermore they are also highly expert dependent and rely on the assumption that study participants can express their preferences consciously and explicitly . In our paper we suggest an electroencephalography based approach to evaluate perceived product similarity in a cross modal taste visual task . We tested two potential neurometrics measured from Fz electrode the amplitude of the N400 like evoked response potentials and the power of induced gamma oscillations during 400600ms period after visual stimulus presentation . Both metrics showed a strong correlation with the perceived similarity scores at both individual and group levels however N400 like amplitude had greater inter subject variability making it less suitable for practical applications . The results based on the power of induced gamma oscillations could be compared to traditional hall tests and may potentially reveal subtle differences in food perception that can not be captured in the hall tests .",
        "Highlights":"EEG metrics can be used to test perceived similarity between different food products. Induced gamma waves reflect concordance between product taste and visual appearance. Higher N430 620 amplitude indicates a mismatch between taste and visual appearance. EEG approaches are comparable to hall tests but can be performed on smaller samples."

Chinese consumers often face confusing information about a particular food product s safety and are concerned about the situation . Drawing upon stress coping theory this study examines whether consumer confusion and negative emotions drive intentions to adopt ethical food . Data collected from a sample of 505 consumers were analyzed using structural equation modeling . The results show that consumer confusion has a significant impact on negative emotions which in turn influence intentions to purchase ethical food products . This research advances the food preference literature by providing a new perspective on ethical consumption based on coping strategies . The findings are important for policymakers and business leaders seeking to develop and better promote safer and more ethical food programs in China .",

However consumer acceptance of insect based foods still poses a big challenge in many societies . Across three studies we examined how social companions and location are associated with peoples willingness to eat insect based foods . We also examined the positive arousing and positive calming emotions that were evoked by several eating contexts . The results of Studies 1 and 2 revealed that participants expected that they would be more willing to eat insect based foods with friends and in pubs and at food festivals . The results of Study 3 replicated the main findings of the first two studies using the actual names of insect based food products namely mealworm burger and cricket chocolate bar . Moreover these contexts where people would be more willing to eat insect based foods were associated with positive arousing emotions rather than positive calming emotions . Taken together then these findings reveal the role of contexts associated with positive arousing emotions in eating insect based foods and provide practical advice concerning the situations in which the consumers acceptance of insect based foods may be increased .",

Study 1 examines the effects of food brand logo orientation on consumer perceptions of food tastiness and risk . The findings suggest that diagonal food brand logos result in higher taste and risk perception in branded food . Study 2 reveals the underlying mechanisms of this effect by introducing perceived movement as a mediator between logo orientation and food perception . The results support the inference that movement is an underlying mechanism for the effect . Study 3 examines the effects of brand logo orientation and regulatory focus on consumer attitudes regarding branded food . The results suggest that for consumers with a promotion focus a diagonal oriented logo leads to a more favorable attitude toward the food . For consumers with a prevention focus a diagonal oriented logo leads to a less favorable attitude toward the food . Study 4 establishes validity of the above findings regarding native English speakers .",
        "Highlights":"Diagonally vs. vertically oriented logos enhance consumer perception of food taste. Vertically vs. diagonally oriented logos decrease consumer perception of food risk. Perceived movement plays a mediating role in logo orientation affecting food perception. For those with a promotion focus a diagonal logo brings a more favorable attitude. For those with a prevention focus a vertical logo brings a more favorable attitude."

        "Abstract":"CATA questions are popular for sensory product characterisation tasks with consumers . Lingering uncertainty over the meaning of term citation frequency was addressed in the present research which directly compared CATA questions with intensity and applicability ratings obtained on 10cm unstructured line scales . In three studies evidence fitting with expectations based on the extant literature was obtained to confirm that citation frequency reflects intensity . The two response types were strongly linearly related meaning that it is possible to infer significant differences between samples for a given CATA term as representing differences in perceived intensity . This finding emphasises how despite the simplicity of the CATA task and the fact that individual responses are not measures of intensity the average citation frequencies do reflect perceived intensity . Therefore across a group of consumers there is no information loss relative to rating scales . A systematic difference between citation frequencies and intensity ratings was attenuation of scale use in the latter which was between 15 and 80 on a 0 to 100 scale . Attenuation was less pronounced in CATA responses which spanned approx . 5 to 85 . In the second part of the research which included six studies CATA questions were compared with applicability ratings obtained on 10cm unstructured line scales . The results were highly similar to the comparison between CATA questions and intensity scales and further confirmed that average CATA term citation frequency can be interpreted as representing consumers intensity perceptions . The attenuation in scale range was again observed . Collectively the results contribute further support for the popularity of CATA questions for sensory characterization by consumers in product testing .",
        "Highlights":"Average citation frequencies of CATA terms reflect but do not directly measure intensity. Sensory term citation frequencies reflect consumers term intensity ratings well. Citation frequency and intensity ratings are very strongly and linearly related. The results extend to comparison of CATA questions with applicability ratings."

Furthermore the perception of saltiness will be different among people when considering their innate sensitivity gender age psychological traits and dietary habits . In this study 31 younger participants and 29 older participants were used as research subjects . A web based questionnaire survey was used to collect information regarding of socio demographics consumption frequency and liking for salty and pungent food as well as personality traits throughout the younger and the older participants . In addition the 6 n propylthiouracil ratings were tested by the generalized Labeled Magnitude Scale in the laboratory conditions . The rated difference from control method was used to test the sensitivity differences in the saltiness of NaCl and the pungent sensation elicited by Sichuan pepper oleoresin between the younger and older groups . The results showed that the thresholds were significantly lower in the younger group than in the older group except for the detection threshold of saltiness . Furthermore the recognition threshold of saltiness decreased in the presence of the sub threshold pungency solution while the salty intensity was enhanced in both the younger and older groups when exposed to the slightly pungent solution compared to the control . For the younger group the enhancement percentage of the salty intensity was between 9.3 and 12.5 while at the concentration of 4.05g L the salty enhancement percentage increased by 6.4 in the older group . In addition the reduction percentageof NaCl reached a level of up to 34.4 in the younger group and was 4.4 in the older group . The Partial Least Squares Regression results indicated that the percentage change in salty intensity increased when the detection threshold of saltiness the sensation seeking ratings and PROP ratings increased . On the contrary the change decreased when the age life satisfaction ratings detection threshold of pungency and consumption frequency of salty food increased . These findings not only provide new information for the flavor design of salt reduced food and dishes but also be valuable to public health as well as economic benefits .",

The study aimed to assess a the ability of tribological measurements to predict a multicomponent sensory property in hard food and b the impact of two common motion patterns on tribological measurements and mathematical correlations with sensory texture of a hard food . The textures of ten apple varieties were evaluated by a trained sensory panel while friction and wear behavior were measured instrumentally . Spearman correlations indicated that texture attributes significantly correlated with total penetration depth and with friction coefficients during the transient phase but not with friction coefficients from the steady state phase in both rotational and linear tribology . This was an important finding as the steady state phase is predominantly used in food tribology research yet our findings showed poor correlations with steady state data while showing strong correlations with sensory perception in the transient phase . The strong mathematical correlations found in the transient phase suggest that test conditions that provoke a dynamic friction response from the sample may more closely resemble the conditions under which humans perceive friction during oral processing .",

Here we tested whether personality traits influence beer liking and intake . Under laboratory conditions beer consumers rated liking and intensity of 2 pale ales and a lager and intensity of two bitter solutions . Participants also completed intake and personality questionnaires . A liking ratio for each beer was calculated from each participants liking for that specific beer and their total liking for all beers . Participants were classified as weekly monthly or yearly pale ale consumers using intake data . Using intensity ratings personality measures and other parameters hierarchical linear regression was used to predict liking ratios and logistic regression was used to predict beer intake frequency . A significant interaction between Sensation Seeking and quinine bitterness was found for the liking ratio of a pale ale . The interaction revealed liking of the pale ale increased with Sensation Seeking but only if quinine bitterness was also high . Intake models showed increased odds of frequent pale ale intake with greater quinine bitterness and lower liking for lager beer . These data suggest liking and intake of pale ales is positively related to Sensation Seeking and bitter taste perception . Contrary to findings in other bitter foods and beverages the high bitterness found in pale ales may be desirable for some consumers .",

In a set of two augmented virtuality studies we investigated whether the results we obtained in real life settings were comparable to the results we obtained in a VR environment . In Study 1 we transferred an existing sensory science experiment to a VR setting . We invited 100 participants to taste two juices and a piece of cake . In the VR environment participants saw the product either in its original colour or in a modified product atypical colour . After the product tasting we asked them to identify the most dominant flavour . Participants had more difficulties identifying the flavour when the product was shown in a modified colour than when it was shown in its original colour . In Study 2 we added an RL control condition to facilitate a direct comparison between the two conditions and to verify our findings from Study 1 .

A principal component analysis showed that variation in sensory attributes could better be explained by product type rather than sample temperature while emotional response variation was attributed more to sample temperature than to product type . Sensory and emotional drivers of liking were also found to differ with sample temperature . Another study in which 66 consumers characterized sensory and emotional attributes of purified water at the four temperatures was conducted . Consumer emotional responses to water samples changed with sample temperature while sensory perception varied only minimally . In conclusion our findings provide empirical evidence that sample temperature significantly influences both emotional responses and sensory attributes and temperature effects vary with the type of food .",
        "Highlights":"Panelists characterized tomato soup samples served at 25 40 55 and 70C. A trained panel found that 5 of 29 sensory attributes changed with temperature. Consumers emotional responses to tomato soup also changed with temperature. Different water temperatures evoked variation in emotional responses. Temperature induced sensory and emotional changes of foods should be considered."

        "Abstract":"The consumption of infusions is affected by many factors namely those associated with culture health and sensory properties . The main goal of this research was to explore and understand consumers perceptions and behaviours regarding consumption and preparation of herbal infusions applying a mixed methodology the evaluation of consumers behaviours assessed through direct self reported measures and indirect methods such as free word association and auto videography . A total of 489 Portuguese consumers replied to a web based questionnaire . Based on their frequency of consumption and availability 60 participants were selected for an observational study . Over 27 of the participants had at least a daily cup of herbal infusion and over 74 had it at least every week . At home participants reported the use of teapots or mugs cups to prepare their infusions and mostly chose bags . Approximately 80 of the respondents removed the bags or loose leaves after steeping mainly based on the infusion colour . The freeword association results show that daily and weekly consumers establish a stronger connection with the sensory emotional health and wellbeing dimensions of the product while less frequent consumers only consider the composition of the herbal infusion . From the observational study it was noticeable that most of the consumers take less than one minute to steep the infusions clearly below the four to ten minutes recommended for the most popular herbal infusions like lemon verbena or peppermint . These results emphasize the need for communication strategies focused on the preparation process to give consumers tools to improve their sensory experience .",
        "Highlights":"Study reports home preparation practices observation and consumers associations. Participants refer using colour intensity to determine steeping duration. Participants prepare the infusions with very short steeping times. Emotions and wellbeing are main drivers of consumption for herbal infusions. Educational level had an impact on the perceptions of less frequent consumers."

In a laboratory experiment using an eye tracking method the authors exposed 165 respondents to planograms containing target products displaying identical FOPs or FOPs with variations . Attention was measured by fixation duration and fixation counts and eye movements were recorded at 250Hz . The findings showed that FOP variations catch respondents attention . Visual saliency has often been defined as a physical property of an object . In the current study we show the importance of also taking into account the interaction of one stimulus with other stimuli . To our knowledge this is the first time that the effects of FOP variations have been investigated . On a managerial level the current study offers a simple and low priced solution to cut through the clutter and catch consumers attention which is the first step to a product purchase .",

However TDS and TCATA share the same limitation they rely on a predefined and necessarily short list of descriptors . Free Comment enables the sensory characterization of a set of products freed of any issue induced by the use of a list of descriptors but for practical reasons collecting FC descriptions concurrently to the product intake is nearly impossible . Attack Evolution Finish is an alternative to TDS and TCATA that replace concurrent by retrospective data collection . In AEF subjects are asked to choose in a list one descriptor for each of the so called periods Attack Evolution and Finish . The paper introduced Free Comment Attack Evolution Finish to extend FC to temporal sensory analysis where descriptor selections of AEF are replaced by FC descriptions . FC AEF has been used at home with 63 consumers having tasted five dark chocolates . The data were analysed product wise and period wise and showed that FC AEF enabled to provide temporal discrimination and characterization of the products . The product wise analyses identified in each period the descriptors of each product enabling this discrimination . The period wise analyses identified for each product the descriptors generating a temporal kinetic of its perception .",

This paper explores how childrens approach to the CATA test influences the outcome based on two case studies that illustrate suitable setups for CATA tests with children of the age group 69 . The children s approach to the CATA task was described with ticking style indicators based on which three ticking style groups were defined . One group ticked only a few attributes probably due to cognitive limitations e.g . lack of reading skills limited vocabulary or ability to focus on the task . The second group gradually increased their number of ticked attributes per sample over the test while the third subgroup ticked a steady number of attributes throughout the test . The two latter groups are likely to represent different test strategies one using the CATA list relatively to the sample space and one using the CATA list as in a more absolute way . Analysis regarding data validity assessed by the detection of pre defined Design of Experiment sample differences and the alignment to a trained panel using Quantitative Descriptive Analysis revealed that ticking style played a crucial role . This study shows the importance of analysing ticking style as a validation strategy for CATA tests run with children and as a tool to gain insights into underlying test strategies .",

However although an increasing body of research currently focuses on the impact of food attributes on consumers whether the sensory correspondences between food shape and name typeface affect consumer reactions is an under researched topic . This paper thus comprises five studies to demonstrate the congruence effect between food shape and name typeface whereby consumers prefer foods with a round shape that are labeled with a round name typeface . This shapetypeface congruence effect is driven by the psychological mechanism of processing fluency which derives from the sensory correspondences between food shape and name typeface . Finally this study identifies an important boundary condition of the congruence effect confirming it affects only the consumer response to hedonic and not utilitarian goods . Using multiple foods and typefaces the findings provide significant implications for processing fluency sensory correspondences and food marketing .",

Although researchers have identified associations between satisfaction with food related life and specific food behaviours it is still not clear how consumers conceptualize this complex construct . The aims of the present study were to explore consumers conceptualization of SWFRL to compare how parents and adolescents in dual headed households perceive SWFRL and to identify aspects that would increase their SWFRL . One hundred and sixty four dual families composed of mother father and at least one adolescent child between 10 and 17years of age participated in the study . They completed a word association task with Being satisfied with my food related life and completed the sentence I would be more satisfied with my food related life if . Participants responses were aligned with the formal definition of SWFRL . References to specific foods and food characteristics were also mentioned in the word association task . No significant differences were found between parents and adolescents in the frequency of mention of responses related to the identified categories and supra categories suggesting lack of differences in their conceptualization of SWFRL . Changes in eating behaviours and individuals resources for purchasing and preparing foods were regarded as the main factors that could increase SWFRL . Differences between family members were found in some of the aspects associated with an increase in SWFRL .

We firstly adopt an attention model which is embedded with global and local attention modules to roughly localize the tooth region in the first stage . Without any interactive operator the attention model so constructed can automatically aggregate pixel wise contextual information and identify coarse tooth boundaries . To better obtain final boundary information we use a fully convolutional network as the second stage to further segment the real tooth area from the attention maps obtained from the first stage .

Conventionally the neurons in a layer indiscriminately share a fixed drop probability which results in difficulty in determining the appropriate value for different tasks . Moreover this static strategy will also incur serious degradation on performance when the conventional dropout is extensively applied to both shallow and deep layers . A question is whether selectively dropping the neurons would realize a better regularization effect . This paper proposes a simple and effective surrogate dropout method whereby neurons are dropped according to their importance . The proposed method has two main stages . The first stage trains a surrogate module that can be jointly optimized along with the neural network to evaluate the importance of each neuron . In the second stage the output of the surrogate module is regarded as a guidance signal for dropping certain neurons approximating the optimal per neuron drop rate when the network converges . Various convolutional neural network architectures and multiple datasets including CIFAR 10 CIFAR 100 SVHN Tiny ImageNet and two medical image datasets are used to evaluate the surrogate dropout method . The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a better regularization effect than the baseline methods .",

        "Highlights":"Autonomously diagnosing learning problems in e learning systems can be challenging due to the lack of teacher resources teachers in e learning. This work proposes to tackle the explainable learning diagnostics problem using attention based explanation mechanisms by performing target source relation prediction. The findings are adoptable to various types of e learning systems to gain insights into their learner states and diagnose their learning problems. This paper identifies the importance to use the close relatives of knowledge to generate prediction decisions in a knowledge tracing model. We propose a Heterogeneous Attention Relative Detector and a Maximum Entropy Regularizer to detect those relatives i.e. knowledge relation discovery. We propose a multi spatial representation of knowledge in expressing knowledge relations in finer granularity and low dimensionality which can be readily generalized to other data driven educational tasks.

        "Abstract":"Domain adaptation learning is proposed as an effective technology for leveraging rich supervision knowledge from the related domain to learn a reliable classifier for a new domain . One popular kind of domain adaptation methods is based on feature representation . However such methods fail to consider the within class and between class relations after obtaining the new representation . In addition they do not consider the negative effects of features that might be redundant or irrelevant to the final classification . To this end a novel domain invariant feature learning method based on the maximum margin criterion and sparsity technique for unsupervised domain adaptation is proposed in this paper referred to as discriminative and informative joint distribution adaptation . Specifically DIJDA adopts the maximum margin criterion in the adaptation process such that the transformed samples are near to those in the same class but segregated from those in different classes . As a result the discriminative knowledge referred from source labels can be transferred to target domain effectively . Moreover DIJDA imposes a row sparsity constraint on the transformation matrix which enforces rows of the matrix corresponding to inessential feature attributes to be all zero . Therefore the most informative feature attributes can be extracted . Compared with several state of the art methods DIJDA substantially improves the classification results on five widely used benchmark datasets which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method .",

This is due to the fact that all traffic is forwarded towards the sink increasing the workloads for these closer nodes . One solution for this issue is to shorten the hop distance a sensors data has to travel until reaching the sink by deploying additional relay nodes . This paper considers the problem of optimal relay node placement for maximizing the network lifetime of wireless sensor networks in three dimensional terrains . We first design a mathematical model of the problem and reformulate it as a mixed integer programming model to provide a basis for finding lower bound solutions . We divide the problem into two phases and show that the second phase can be solved exactly using an algorithm based on maximum flow and binary search . We then propose a local search algorithm for the first phase utilizing the exact algorithm to create full solutions . Experimental validation on 3D datasets has been carried out to demonstrate the performance of our algorithms .",

        "Abstract":"Compact optimization is an alternative paradigm in the field of metaheuristics requiring a modest use of memory to optimize a problem . As opposed to population based algorithms which conduct the search by employing a set of candidate solutions compact algorithms use a probabilistic model to describe how solutions are distributed over the search space . Compared to other Estimation of Distribution Algorithms peculiar features such as the use of simple probabilistic models in which variables are treated independently and the need for a minimal number of solutions to be sampled to perform the search make these algorithms suitable for those applications plagued by memory limitations . Compact algorithms show good results on different kinds of optimization problems but often prematurely converge and perform poorly on non separable . In this paper we attempt to overcome these limitations by combining compact algorithms with a restart mechanism named Re Sampled Inheritance whose purpose is to avoid premature convergence while also inheriting parts of the variables from the best solution found so far . To assess the effect of the RI mechanism we extensively test various existing compact algorithms with and without RI and compare the best RI based compact algorithm against several competing algorithms on several optimization problems at different dimensionalities . We also evaluate the effect of the RI parameters on the overall algorithmic performance . Our numerical results not only show that RI consistently enhances the performances of compact algorithms but also shed some light on the effectiveness of different compact logics at handling problems at different dimensionalities .",

Several scores involving must link and can not link constraints have been proposed to estimate the relevance of features . However these constraint scores evaluate features one by one and ignore any correlation between them . In addition they compute distance in the high dimensional original feature space to evaluate similarity between samples . So they would be corrupted by the curse of dimensionality . To deal with these drawbacks we propose a new constraint score based on a similarity matrix that is computed in the selected feature subspace and that makes it possible to evaluate the relevance of a feature subset at once .

Deficiency of the existing DES algorithm in dealing with imbalanced data is the major challenge . In this paper a novel combined DES model is developed for imbalanced learning problems . To handle the imbalanced data sets the synthetic minority over sampling technique is initially used to balance a training set before generating a candidate classifier pool then the weighting mechanism of DES MI is used to highlight the importance of minority instances when evaluating classifier competences . To further ensure the comprehensive evaluation and right selection of the ensemble classifier the meta learning framework of META DES is used to account for multiple criteria and the two step selection strategy of DES KNN is employed to perform a trade off between the competence and diversity of the classifiers . Our experiments on 15 imbalanced data sets from the KEEL repository show that the proposed model improves the performance of seven known and popular DES algorithms in terms of the area under the curve .

One of the major arguments used to justify Australia s policy is that the availability of nicotine vaping products will lead a substantial number of young people who would otherwise not have smoked cigarettes to take up regular smoking . In this article we provide a critical analysis of the use of the gateway theory to justify Australian policy . We argue first that the evidence that vaping serves as a gateway to smoking is unconvincing . Smoking more often precedes vaping than vice versa regular vaping by never smokers is rare and the association is more plausibly explained by a common liability model . Second we argue that even if the evidence were stronger it would not justify a ban on the sale of nicotine to adult smokers because there are other ways of preventing adolescent vaping that do not require a ban . We describe an alternative regulatory model for Australia that would address legitimate concerns about preventing adolescent uptake while allowing adult smokers to access these products for cessation or as an alternative to smoking cigarettes .",

A more nuanced regulatory policy could restrict young nonsmokers access to vaping while allowing access for adult smokers."

        "Abstract":"Drug overdose is a significant public health problem yet little is known about racial ethnic differences in drug overdose rates and or in responses to a drug overdose following naloxone administration . This paper examines differences in rates of survivorship response revival and administration of naloxone by race and ethnicity among those who experienced a drug overdose in Pennsylvania between January 1 2018 and December 31 2019 . Spatio temporal variations in drug overdose locations were examined to facilitate understanding of service development planning and delivery of effective treatment need . Ten thousand two hundred and ninety drug overdose incidents were analyzed from the Pennsylvania Overdose Information Network . The ODIN is a centralized repository that contains information on drug overdoses victims including age gender and race ethnicity naloxone administrations and survivorship drug suspected of causing the overdose victim outcomes and average naloxone dosage per victim . Between group differences were tested using 2 tests of independence . Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the predicted probability of survivorship according to victim characteristics . All statistical analyses and mapping were performed using the R statistical programming environment . About eighty seven percent of drug overdose response victims were white and seventy one percent were between the ages of 2039 . White females were more likely to receive an overdose response compared to black or Hispanic females . A non opioid was indicated more frequently in overdoses involving black victims compared to either whites or Latinos . Latinos and blacks were more likely to survive a drug overdose . However following naloxone administration no racial or ethnic differences in survivorship were noted . Differences in responsiveness to naloxone and transitions to care following the drug overdose event were also found . Finally overdoses among Blacks and Latinos demonstrated a stronger spatial patterning across counties compared to whites . This study found a significant disparate impact of race ethnicity on fatal drug overdoses when naloxone is not administered . Further individuals who were administered naloxone and subsequently received medical care in a hospital experienced lower drug related mortality suggesting that first responders are critical intervention points for individuals in need of medical treatment following a drug overdose . However while naloxone administration is a necessary first step in the recovery process longitudinal pathways towards treatment are critical to stem the drug overdose crisis .",
        "Highlights":"The odds of surviving a drug overdose are more than 5 times higher if naloxone is administered regardless of race ethnicity. Racial differences in fatal drug overdose exist in the absence of naloxone administration. No racial differences in survivorship were noted following naloxone administration. Responsiveness to naloxone and transitions to care following a drug overdose differed by race ethnicity. Overdose responses among blacks and Latinos demonstrated stronger spatial and temporal patterning compared to whites."

Research shows that sense of home may have important implications for mitigating harms associated with low income housing environments among PLHIV who use drugs but how this shapes treatment is poorly understood . Semi structured interviews were conducted with 31 PLHIV who use drugs recruited from an ongoing prospective cohort in Vancouver Canada . Recruitment was targeted towards individuals living in single room occupancy housing who had previously reported low treatment adherence . Interviews were co led with a peer research assistant and focused on housing conditions drug use patterns and HIV management . Interviews were transcribed analyzed thematically and interpreted by drawing on concepts of home and place making . The ability to exert control over housing environments contributed to participants perceptions of home by fostering feelings of safety and allowing for creation of personalized space . Participants readily identified the importance of housing stability and quality in maintaining health including HIV care . However informed by social structural mechanisms that undermined agency negative experiences of home adversely impacted treatment adherence . Findings indicate that sense of home may enable ability to manage HIV care and is promoted through feelings of security within and control over housing environments . Supports in navigating competitive housing markets are needed to address the role that home plays in HIV treatment adherence .",

        "Abstract":"Catalonia requires decentralized and simplified strategies for the diagnosis of viremic HCV infection among people who inject drugs . We aimed to perform a direct comparison of the diagnostic performance between two single step strategies for the screening and diagnosis of viremic HCV infection in PWID attending a drug consumption room in Barcelona i on site HCV RNA testing using the point of care test Xpert HCV VL Fingerstick and ii on site dried blood spots collection for HCV RNA testing at the laboratory . Additionally we aimed to assess participants preferences in receiving HCV RNA testing results and feasibility of same day delivery of PoCT results . The real world clinical performance of these two strategies was established in comparison with the reference method . HCV genotypes subtypes and HIV status were also determined by sequencing and serology respectively . A questionnaire including preferences regarding the delivery of test results was administered . The prevalence of HCV RNA was 63.0 . The RNA PoCT showed a sensitivity of 98.4 for detectable viral loads and of 100 for quantifiable viral loads . For the DBS based assay a sensitivity of 93.7 was obtained for detectable viral loads 96.7 for the quantifiable 10 IU mL threshold and 98.3 for both the quantifiable 1000 and 3000 IU mL thresholds . No significant differences were detected between the sensitivity values of these two strategies and the specificity was 100 in both cases . Half of the participants preferred to receive the HCV RNA result on the same day and 80 of participants received their RNA PoCT results on the same day . Both the HCV RNA PoCT and the DBS based assay are highly reliable tools for the simplified diagnosis of viremic HCV infection among current PWID . These strategies allow for on site sample collection and delivery of test results facilitating decentralized care in harm reduction services .",
        "Highlights":"The Xpert FS PoCT and the DBS based HCV RNA assay are simple and reliable methods for HCV testing in PWID. The sensitivity and specificity were not significantly different between assays in our real world setting. 50.0 of the participants preferred to receive the HCV RNA results on the same day. Same day delivery of PoCT results was feasible in 80 of the cases."

        "Abstract":"People who inject drugs have high rates of hepatitis C and yet many remain undiagnosed and untreated . HCV treatment guidelines and elimination strategies recommend task shifting to expand where and by whom HCV testing and care is delivered . A randomized controlled trial design was used to evaluate if point of care HCV antibody testing by peer outreach workers outside of health and social service spaces would improve engagement in HCV care . People with a lifetime history of injection drug use without prior knowledge of HCV antibody status were randomized to receive HCV outreach plus either POC or referral to community based HCV program for testing as usual . The study was co designed by people with lived experience of HCV . 920 people were approached to participate over 14 weeks . After refusals withdrawals and removal of duplicates there were 380 study participants . Outreach took place primarily in public spaces such as parks coffee shops and apartment lobbies . Participants reported very high rates of poverty housing instability and recent injection drug use . Despite being at high risk for HCV 61 had no history or knowledge of past HCV testing Peer outreach workers were able to efficiently reach a marginalized group of individuals who had a high HCV antibody prevalence and low rates of prior HCV testing . This improved participants knowledge of their HCV antibody status but that knowledge in itself did not lead to any change in participant s subsequent engagement in HCV care . Future work is required to evaluate strategies such as incentives or peer navigators to improve linkage to HCV care after diagnosis .",

The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between injecting alone and use of drug checking services in Vancouver Canada . Data were derived from three prospective cohort studies of people who inject drugs . We conducted bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis to estimate the effect of injecting alone on use of drug checking services . Between May 2018 and December 2018 a total of 793 people who inject drugs were included in the study 579 reported injecting alone and 177 reported use of drug checking services . In a multivariable model adjusted for various confounders injecting alone was negatively associated with use of drug checking services . We observed a negative association between injecting drugs alone and use of drug checking services which may be due in part to a number of exogenous factors that prevent people who inject alone from accessing drug checking services . As these individuals are at heightened risk of experiencing overdoses there is a need to pursue other strategies to reach this group of people who use drugs .",

This study was conducted to determine whether use of analgesics changed following codeine re scheduling to prescription only status and whether there was a change in the use of codeine preparations and a therapeutic shift to stronger opioids or other analgesics in the Australian veteran population following the change . Interrupted time series analysis using Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme claims data from the Australian Government Department of Veterans Affairs for clients with dispensing of opioid and non opioid analgesics between January 2015 and April 2019 . Trends in the monthly rate of analgesic dispensings were compared for the period between January 2015 and January 2018 with the period February 2018 to April 2019 . Paracetamol with codeine 8mg was the only analgesic with an increased rate of dispensing following the February 2018 codeine scheduling changes . Prior to codeine re scheduling the rate of dispensing of paracetamol with codeine 8mg was decreasing by 0.9 each month . Immediately after the scheduling changes dispensing of paracetamol with codeine 8mg increased by 45 and in the fifteen month period thereafter the rate of dispensing increased by 4 each month . Therapeutic shift from over the counter codeine products to other opioids was not observed with no increase in the rate of dispensing of any of the other opioid analgesics following the codeine scheduling changes . A significant increase in prescription use of paracetamol with codeine 8mg was observed after the February 2018 codeine re scheduling . Therapeutic shift to stronger opioid analgesics was not observed in the study population .",
        "Highlights":"Regulatory changes can result in unintended effects on medicines use. The 2018 re scheduling of low dose codeine in Australia resulted in no therapeutic shift to stronger opioids or non opioid analgesics in the veteran population.

We conducted the first study comparing differences in demographics drug use and nightlife behaviour between an online sample of young adults engaging with the European nightlife scene and an offline sample recruited at nightclubs and festivals in Europe . Online participants who attended at least six nightlife events in the past 12 months were recruited using social media advertising . Offline participants were recruited at nightclubs and festivals using a random intercept method . Samples were compared with respect to age gender past year use of alcohol cannabis cocaine ecstasy MDMA and amphetamines and past year attendance at nightclubs licensed festivals illegal festivals pubs and house parties . 6153 online and 3529 offline participants were recruited . When adjusting for differences in age and gender online participants were less likely to have used each drug and to have attended illegal festivals pubs and house parties in the past 12 months . The online sample also used each drug and attended each venue with the exception of nightclubs less frequently on average than offline participants . Adjusted odds ratios and regression coefficients indicate that the majority of observed differences between the samples were of a small effect size . Estimates of drug use and nightlife engagement are more conservative when using online sampling compared to venue based sampling .

While marked differences in vulnerability to drug related harm between men and women who use drugs is well characterized the extent to which gender differences manifest in the present overdose crisis remains understudied . We examined differences in self reported unintentional exposure to fentanyl between men and women who use drugs . Data were derived from three prospective cohorts of people who use drugs in Vancouver Canada . Survey data were extracted on individuals who self reported having used drugs known or believed to contain fentanyl in the past 30 days between December 2016 and November 2017 .

We aimed to estimate prevalence and correlates of injecting risk behaviours amongst PWID . We conducted a systematic review and meta analyses to estimate country regional and global prevalences of injecting risk behaviours . Using meta regression analyses we determined associations between study and country level characteristics and receptive needle syringe sharing . From 61 077 identified papers and reports and 61 studies from expert consutation evidence on injecting risk behaviours was available for 464 studies from 88 countries . Globally it is estimated that 17.9 of PWID engaged in receptive needle syringe sharing at last injection 23.9 in the past month and 32.8 in the past 612 months . Receptive sharing of other injecting equipment was common . Higher prevalence of receptive needle syringe sharing in the previous month was associated with samples of PWID with a lower proportion of females shorter average injecting duration a higher proportion with daily injecting and older studies . Countries with lower development index higher gender inequality and lower NSP coverage had higher proportions reporting receptive needle syringe sharing . High levels of injecting risk behaviours were observed amongst PWID globally although estimates were only available for half of the countries with evidence of injecting drug use . There is a need for better capturing of injecting risk behaviours in these countries to inform implementation of harm reduction services and evaluate potential impacts of interventions to reduce risk .",

This paper aimed to explore three stages of intoxication feeling the effects being as drunk as you would like to be and reaching the tipping point in a large international sample . The Global Drug Survey is an annual cross sectional online survey of drug use . This paper draws on data from 61 043 respondents from 21 countries who took part in GDS2015 collected in November 2014 to January 2015 . Respondents reported their usual type of drink how many drinks they would require to reach each stage of intoxication and how frequently they reached each stage . Alongside socio demographic measures they also completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test . Male respondents reported consuming 87.55 gm to be as drunk as they want to be and female respondents reported 70.16 gm on average . The tipping point was reached at 138.65 gm for male respondents and 106.54 gm for female respondents . Overall 20.3 reported reaching their tipping point at least once a month . Being male aged under 25 and at higher risk for alcohol use disorder was associated with reporting reaching the tipping point more frequently . The amount of alcohol being consumed to reach a desired point of intoxication is much higher than the maximum daily and sometimes weekly amount recommended by country guidelines . Encouraging people to avoid reaching their tipping point may be a useful intervention point alongside better communication of low risk drinking guidelines .",

In depth interviews Fentanyl was viewed as pervasive dangerous and difficult to avoid in the local drug supply . This dominant narrative characterized PWUD as disempowered by the heightened unpredictability of the drug market . While several strategies are used to navigate the drug market respondents wanted more information about their drugs . In this context fentanyl test strips were used in unique and unexpected ways to empower PWUD to be savvier market consumers including avoiding fentanyl when there could be negative social or legal consequences negotiating with dealers and helping others in their social network navigate the opaque drug market . These findings add nuance and place fentanyl preference and use in the context of the drug market . When fentanyl presence is assumed people used fentanyl test strips in unexpected ways to gain some control over their drug use . Novel uses for fentanyl test strips strengthen existing strategies used to navigate the drug market and mitigate overdose risk and highlight their potential to quickly disseminate valuable information about the local drug supply .",
        "Highlights":"Little is known about the utility of take home fentanyl test strips in fentanyl rich environments. Perceived agency and power over drug use are shaped by perceptions of fentanyl ubiquity and uncertainty about the drug market. People who use drugs need reliable information about drug composition to control their use and mitigate overdose risk. Fentanyl test strips were used in unexpected ways to promote agency and improve existing strategies to navigate the opaque drug market. Fentanyl test strips are valuable tools to inform networks of dealers and people who use drugs about fentanyl presence."

        "Abstract":"Engaging the community in decisions making is recognised as important for improving public health and is recommended in global alcohol strategies and in national policies on controlling alcohol availability . Yet there is little understanding of We conducted case studies in three local government areas in England in 2018 purposively selected for examples of community engagement in decisions affecting the local alcohol environment . We conducted 20 semi structured interviews with residents workers local politicians and local government practitioners and analysed documents linked to engagement and alcohol decision making . Four rationales for engaging the community in decision making affecting the alcohol environment were identified i as part of statutory decision making processes ii to develop new policies iii as representation on committees and iv occurring through relationship building . Many of the examples related to alcohol licensing processes but also local economy and community safety decision making . The impact of community inputs on decisions was often not clear but there were a few instances of engagement influencing the process and outcome of decision making relating to the alcohol environment . While influencing statutory licensing decision making is challenging community experiences of alcohol related harms can be valuable evidence to support new licensing policies . Informal relationship building between communities and local government is also beneficial for sharing information about alcohol related harms and to facilitate future engagement . However care must be taken to balance the different interests among diverse community actors relating to the local alcohol environment and extra support is needed for those with least capacity to engage but who face more burden of alcohol related harms to avoid compounding existing inequalities .",
        "Highlights":"Community experience of alcohol harm can be valuable evidence to support policies. Navigating formal licensing processes remains challenging for communities. Building relationships around local alcohol issues may support engagement. Conflicting community interests in the alcohol environment must be considered. Alcohol related inequalities may be exacerbated through engagement"

Cross sectional survey recruiting an international non probability sample of people who use alcohol and other drugs as part of the annual Global Drug Survey . Online questionnaire translated into 19 languages . 110 557 people took part in GDS2020 and 88 124 completed a question about inhaling alcohol in the last 12 months . The focus of this study is GDS2020 respondents who reported inhaling alcohol mist vapour from a balloon in the last 12 months . Last 12 month use of alcohol vapour onset duration intensity of effects value for money compared with alcohol and incidence of falls injuries . A total of 803 people reported the use of alcohol vapour in the last 12 months with 51 of the sample coming from 3 countries Australia Denmark and England . Two thirds were male and they were more likely to be under 25 . 45.7 reported that they were a bit very drunk before they inhaled alcohol . 51.3 reported that the effects lasted for less than 5mins . Both the intensity of effect and perceived value for money showed a normal distribution on a 10 point scale . 12.7 of respondents reported falling injuring themselves . Inhaling alcohol vapour appears to be more common amongst younger higher risk drinkers . The rapid onset of action and inability to titrate consumption to effect is a risk for acute injury . We consider that alcohol is harmful enough through oral consumption without adding to the risk of injury by offering such a potentially risky additional administration method .",
        "Highlights":"Alcohol is usually taken orally but a recent trend to inhale its vapours or mists has emerged and little is known about this experience and its effects. In a global study respondents from Australia denmark and england had tried this practice 45.7 were already drunk when they did so and 12.7 of whom had fallen or injured themselves afterwards. Inhaling alcohol vapours or mists may contribute to excessive intoxication and harm. Further research is needed to understand more about the associated risks and harms in order to inform public health policy and licensing decisions."

Past research has underscored the importance of treatment initiation in shaping onward treatment trajectories however structural factors that influence participants motivations to access injectable HDM or DAM have not been fully characterized . This study examines peoples motivations for accessing HDM DAM treatment and situates these within the social and structural context that shapes treatment delivery by employing the concept of structural vulnerability . Fifty two individuals enrolled in injectable HDM DAM programs were recruited from four community based clinical programs in Vancouver Canada to participate in qualitative semi structured interviews . Approximately 50h of ethnographic fieldwork was also completed in one clinical setting and one on one with participants public spaces . Interview transcripts and ethnographic fieldnotes were analyzed through a structural vulnerability lens with a focus on treatment initiation . Participants previous experiences and perceptions of other drug treatments foregrounded their initiation of injectable HDM DAM . Social and structural factors influenced participants motivations to address immediate physical risks and their initial perception of this treatment s ability to align with their opioid use experiences . Similar social and structural factors that drive immediate physical risks were also evidenced in participants motivations to make changes in their daily lives and to address broader opioid use goals . Participants descriptions of their motivations to initiate HDM DAM highlight how structural vulnerabilities shaped participants experiences initiating injectable HDM DAM .",

This cross sectional study examined trends in exclusive and dual smoking identified new poly consumption patterns and profiled old and new nicotine users . We used the annual cross sectional ESPAD Italia survey which sampled students currently used for surveillance and monitoring of at risk population between 2012 and 2018 The lifetime prevalence of cigarette smokers slightly decreased from 60.9 in 2012 to 56.9 in 2018 whereas the proportion of vaping users substantially increased from 32.9 in 2013 to 52.0 in 2018 . Combining cigarette and vaping use these trends result in an increase in the lifetime prevalence of any use from 60.8 in 2013 to 66.2 in 2018 . Three out of every 10 minors have experienced smoking and or vaping and younger students were more prone to be dual users . Overall current vapers were generally less prone to risky behaviours . In contrast to a slight decrease in cigarette smoking the prevalence of Italian students approaching old and or new smoking habits in their lifetime is substantially increasing . The popularity of alternative nicotine based products particularly e cigarettes has increased among teenagers resulting in a summation of usage patterns rather than a compensation and attracting a novel slice of young users . The lack of regulation within current drug policy to limit the access to such licit psychoactive substance use is urgently needed to avoid a future nicotine addicted population .",

        "Abstract":"Evidence details how cannabis can influence the use of other psychoactive substances including prescription medications alcohol tobacco and illicit drugs but very little research has examined the factors associated with these changes in substance use patterns . This paper explores the self reported use of cannabis as a substitute for alcohol among a Canadian medical cannabis patient population . Data was derived from a survey of 2102 people enrolled in the Canadian medical cannabis program . We included 973 respondents who reported using alcohol on at least 10 occasions over a 12 month period prior to initiating medical cannabis and then used retrospective data on the frequency and amount of alcohol use pre and post medical cannabis initiation to determine which participant characteristics and other variables were associated with reductions and or cessation of alcohol use . Overall 419 participants reported decreases in alcohol usage frequency over 30 days 323 decreased the number of standard drinks they had per week and 76 reported no alcohol use at all in the 30 days prior to the survey . Being below 55 years of age and reporting higher rates of alcohol use in the pre period were both associated with greater odds of reducing alcohol use and an intention to use medical cannabis to reduce alcohol consumption was associated with significantly greater odds of both reducing and ceasing alcohol use altogether . Our findings suggest that medical cannabis initiation may be associated with self reported reductions and cessation of alcohol use among medical cannabis patients . Since alcohol is the most prevalent recreational substance in North America and its use results in significant rates of criminality morbidity and mortality these findings may result in improved health outcomes for medical cannabis patients as well as overall improvements in public health and safety .",

In response some supervised injection services in Canada have begun to permit clients to be physically injected by fellow clients or staff members . However little is known about uptake and characteristics of clients who engage in this practice . We therefore sought to examine factors associated with receiving injection assistance at SIS among people who require help injecting drugs in Vancouver Canada . Data were drawn from two community recruited prospective cohort studies of people who inject drugs . We used multivariable generalized estimating equation analyses with time updated covariates to identify factors associated with self reported receipt of injection assistance at SIS .

However studies in resource poor countries remain limited . Therefore we conducted this study to explore factors associated with HIV HCV co infection among people who inject drugs in Cambodia . This national survey was conducted in 2017 in the capital city and 11 provinces . We used a peer based social network recruitment method to recruit 286 participants for face to face interviews and HIV and HCV testing . A modified Cox proportional hazard model was used to identify risk factors associated with HIV HCV co infection . The prevalence of HIV and HCV was 15.4 and 30.4 respectively . Of the total 9.4 of the participants were HIV HCV co infected and 61.4 of the HIV infected participants were co infected with HCV . About half of the participants tested HIV positive were aware of their HIV status of whom 83.3 were on antiretroviral therapy . Only 11.5 of the participants with HCV antibody positivity were aware of their HCV infection status of whom 50.0 were on HCV treatment . The adjusted prevalence ratio of HIV HCV co infection was significantly higher among women than among men and among participants who lived on the streets than among those living with their family or relatives . The APR of HIV HCV co infection was also significantly higher among participants who had received methadone maintenance therapy than those who had not received it . The prevalence of HIV HCV co infection among people who inject drugs in Cambodia was considerably high . Intervention programs are required to increase access to harm reduction interventions among most marginalized people who inject drugs to prevent HIV and HCV infection .

This work focuses on the valorization of spent fluid catalytic cracking catalyst from oil refineries which generate 400 000 metric tons of spent catalyst per year worldwide most of which is sent to landfills . A new alternative to landfilling is proposed for this waste based on the combination of acid leaching for the recovery of lanthanum a valuable rare earth and the reuse of the leached solid residue as a cement substitute . A comparative life cycle assessment was made including four environmental impact categories i.e . global warming fossil resource scarcity mineral resource scarcity and water consumption in order to quantify the potential environmental benefits of secondary lanthanum recovery from industrial waste with respect to primary lanthanum extraction from mineral resources . A maximum of 85.6 La recovery was achieved and 15wt of cement can be substituted with leached solid residue without changing the original cement classification . The waste management process presented in this paper promotes the sustainable management of the spent fluid catalytic cracking catalyst and contributes to the development of a new resource for a critical material such as lanthanum . The implementation of this novel waste management process could reduce global warming and mineral resource scarcity but would increase fossil resource scarcity and water consumption in comparison with primary La extraction .",

The results indicated that HTT as a pretreatment method achieved the redistribution and preliminary immobilization of the HMs decreasing the potential environmental risk level . After HTP the HMs were more immobilized and this effect was enhanced when the pyrolysis temperature was increased from 300 to 800C . However Zn Cd and Pb evaporated under high temperature . Leaching experiments revealed that all the HMs in the pyro char from pyrolysis at 800C were below the standard . The influences of the HR and pyrolysis time on the HM immobilization were slight under a higher temperature . After HTP the HM environmental risk decreased to a low level . The physicochemical characteristics of the pyro char demonstrated that carbon trapping and chemical sedimentation played leading roles in the middle temperature range while mineral matrix encapsulation might have been dominant under high temperature .",

Approximately 1200 historical landfill leachate and groundwater records were surveyed from semi annual and annual monitoring reports covering a 9 year period . Laboratory leaching experiments were conducted on soils from each of these sites to determine if the source could have been boron mobilized from naturally occurring soils . Historical leachate quality data from lined landfills near four of the unlined C D debris landfills were examined to determine if leachate from the unlined landfills could be the boron source . The US Environmental Protection Agency Method 1312 or Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure and the EPA Method 1316 were performed on materials commonly found in C D debris to see if these products have the potential to leach appreciable levels of boron .

Results showed that the RL treatment positively impacted sludge conditioning to weak acidity and hydrolyzed the carbohydrates and proteins released from the matrix of the extracellular polymeric substance . When RL was coupled with high temperature thermal treatments soluble chemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand solubilization increased by 9.619.7 times and 13.429.3 respectively . The RL treatment reduced antibiotic resistant bacteria by 5.498.4 and antibiotic activity was further accelerated by high temperature thermal treatment .

We propose a novel approach in which the ashes deriving from municipal solid waste incineration are combined with poultry litter ash rather than with coal combustion flue gas desulfurisation residues . Heavy metals stabilisation was demonstrated by comparing the elemental concentrations in the leaching solutions of the starting raw and stabilised materials leachable Pb and Zn showed a reduced solubility . The characterisation was conducted by total reflection X ray fluorescence X ray diffraction micro Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X ray spectrometry . The results showed that the poultry litter ash was Ca P K and S rich . It contained amorphous materials 73 and fly ash cyclone 61 and soluble phases as well as resilient crystalline and amorphous phases . After two months the Pb and Zn concentrations in the leachate solutions were below the limit set by the European regulations for waste disposal . We propose a mechanism for the heavy metals stabilisation based on the carbonation process and high amounts of P Ca and reactive amorphous phases . In conclusion it is demonstrated that poultry litter ash can be an effective secondary source of heavy metals allowing their immobilisation through P and Ca based reactive amorphous phases .",

The aim of this study was to identify material efficiency indicators suitable to reflect the environmental performance of waste and recycling systems using PET bottle waste management in three European countries with diverse waste management structures and recycling performance levels . Material flow analysis and life cycle assessment were performed to assess the material efficiency and environmental impacts of each system as a basis to analyze the relation between these two dimensions . PET bottle waste generation was 5.4kg person and year in Austria in 2013 6.0kg pa in Germany in 2017 and 6.9kg pa in Serbia in 2015 . Out of this waste flow 41 91 and 11 were directed into PET recyclate in Austria Germany and Serbia respectively . For all systems higher material efficiency translated into lower environmental impact and vice versa . However linear regression analysis between different material efficiency indicators and environmental impacts showed that indicators targeted at actual recycling specifically at closed loop were better suited to reflect environmental performance than input based indicators . Therefore whenever data are available output based quality related indicators should be used to measure the material efficiency of waste and resource systems because they correlate best with the goals of increasing resource efficiency and decreasing environmental impacts .",

Hardened bitumen causes certain distresses in pavement that may endanger traffic safety and reduce travel comfort . Bitumen is one of recoverable material however some techniques may not be ecological due to considerable energy time and cost . On the other hand recovering of aged bitumen might be eco friendlier energy efficient and economic by using bio based waste materials such as waste vegetable cooking oils . In this perspective this paper was established on the idea of sustainable recovery of aged bitumen and WVCO . Base bitumen was aged in case of short term and long term in laboratory condition and modified with WVCO ranging from 2 to 10 by weight of bitumen . To determine the effect of WVCO modification on aged bitumen conventional and rheological test methods were utilized . To find the optimum rate of WVCO for full recovery of aged bitumen an index called Pure Rejuvenation Index was specified and applied for each test results . It can be concluded from PRI analyses that WVCO can be used as rejuvenator to recover aged bitumen and approximately 3 and 6 of WVCO are required for ST and LT aged bitumen cases respectively . However different test methods yield different optimum rates of WVCO for ST and LT aged bitumen . Recovering of WVCO and aged bitumen by using together may provide environmental protection and conservation of resources .",

This article uses econometric analysis to perform regional specific projections for collected MSW . Four scenarios are presented three of which include sorting of food waste from the mixed MSW stream and or capping mixed MSW generation . In the different scenarios aggregated on a national level mixed MSW ranges from 159 million metric tons to 340 MMT and sorted food waste from MSW from zero to 109 MMT in 2050 .

To that end we apply the recent statistic developed by Phillips and Sul which allows us to test for the null hypothesis of convergence . In the present case this hypothesis is equivalent to admitting that the waste generation follows a similar path across the Spanish regions . Our results lead us to reject this hypothesis which implies that Spanish regional waste generation is quite heterogenous and exhibits several patterns of behavior . We observe that the northern regions exhibit the lowest waste ratios while the insular and Mediterranean coast regions have the highest waste generation . This different behavior is also explained by some socioeconomic factors . Per capita income environmental spending and education level are helpful in this regard . The population dispersion and the number of years that a region has been governed by a left wing party are also associated with lower levels of waste generation . Finally we can also observe that the regions with the highest levels of waste generation are greatly dependent on the tourism industry .

In Turkey the government has yet to develop management strategies that successfully prevent or minimize dumping into the Marmara Sea . One potential solution is the utilization of the DMs as a source of material for earthworks particularly in sanitary landfills in Istanbul and Kocaeli . The most economically developed cities in Turkey they were evaluated in terms of potential environmental impacts and regulatory compliance . Five ports harbors representing specific portions of the study area and different industrial activities were selected as pilot regions . Physical chemical mineralogical toxicological and leaching potential measurements of DMs dredged from the seabed revealed they qualify as non hazardous waste . Index and engineering tests performed on raw and processed DMs were assessed to determine the geotechnical requirements for soil based materials used in sanitary landfills . The results showed that non hazardous DMs could be utilized as a cover base cap liner and or fill material at various sections within the landfills . This method provides environmental advantages not seen with other management strategies for DMs such as dumping at sea or upland disposal .",

The results implied that the wetting rate of the fly ash after treated by waste fried oil was decreased meanwhile the contact angle was increased . A significant decrease in wetting heat was observed which indicated a weaker interaction between deionized water and fly ash after treatment with waste fried oil . Flotation tests showed that the content of unburned carbon could be reduced effectively through froth flotation when took waste fried oil as collector . FTIR analysis testified that waste fried oil had abundant oxygen containing groups that could be adsorbed in a carbonaceous matter to achieve hydrophobization . X ray photoelectron spectroscopy scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive analyses showed that the main compositions of flotation concentrate products were unburned carbon whereas the tailing products consist of aluminum and silicon which confirmed the superior separation performance when the waste fried oil was used as a collector in coal fly ash flotation .

This study presents a new methodology for assessing the environmental sustainability in the food energy water health nexus on a life cycle basis . The environmental impacts estimated through life cycle assessment are used to determine a total impact on the nexus by assigning each life cycle impact to one of the four nexus aspects . These are then normalised weighted and aggregated to rank the options for each aspect and determine an overall nexus impact . The outputs of the assessment are visualised in a nexus quadrilateral to enable structured and transparent interpretation of results . The methodology is illustrated by considering resource recovery from household food waste within the context of a circular economy . The impact on the nexus of four treatment options is quantified anaerobic digestion in vessel composting incineration and landfilling . Anaerobic digestion is environmentally the most sustainable option with the lowest overall impact on the nexus . Incineration is the second best option but has a greater impact on the health aspect than landfilling . Landfilling has the greatest influence on the water aspect and the second highest overall impact on the nexus . In vessel composting is the worst option overall despite being favoured over incineration and landfilling in circular economy waste hierarchies .

The experimental procedure detailed herein assesses different process schemes based on the low temperature reaction known as hydrothermal carbonization . The performances of two lab scale reactor configurations with and without a downstream flash expansion step were evaluated and compared . Each setup was tested with six different types of waste biomass . Fir beech and olive prunings are representative of lignocellulosic raw materials while potato pea and carrot are representative of non lignocellulosic wastes from processing in the local agro food industry . The batch reactions were carried out for up to 120min . The hydrochars were characterized by elemental composition humidity heating value and mass and energy yields . The extent of difference between the results obtained for the two procedures varied significantly with the material treated . At a residence time of 30min the solid yields increased due to expansion ranging from 10 to 36 for lignocellulosic material and 50 to 220 for agro food industry scraps . The downstream flash expansion step causes an increase of the solid yields especially for hydrochars from lignocellulosic materials leading to higher energy recovered compared to the configuration without expansion . Lignocellulosic and agro food wastes behaved dissimilarly likely because of different hydrothermal reaction pathways . The additional expansion step can considerably increase the efficiency of energy recovery in full scale plants the extent of which depends on the biomass waste substrate used .",

However cover characteristics and vacuum pressure are also important design parameters and different combinations of them result in different distributions of gas pressure in the waste some of which would induce problematic air intrusion while others might pose threat to cover stability . This paper uses the maximum gas pressure directly below cover to distinguish these combinations and provides the first study of the effects of the above parameters on potential outcomes . The ability of the overlying cover to resist LFG emission from the landfilled waste is suggested not to exceed a critical value otherwise the maximum gas pressure below it would become at least 1kPa larger than atmospheric pressure . A design formula for this critical value is proposed with respect to typical values of waste properties vacuum pressure and the buried depth of horizontal wells in wide ranges . Together with consideration of recovery efficiency the proposed method can be used to design a horizontal extraction gas collection system and a cover system in better working condition and to evaluate the maximum gas pressure below cover . These applications are illustrated by a worked example .",

Although these topics have been broadly studied at country level studies addressing sub national units are still limited . This research aims to contribute to this field by analyzing the waste generation and recycling processes across the Portuguese municipalities during the period 20092018 . The paper assesses the decoupling hypothesis consistent with the environmental Kuznets curve advocating that a threshold of development is reached and afterwards environmental degradation declines through less waste production and higher recycling rates . To address this hypothesis the waste generation and recycling equations are estimated using as fundamentals the total production activity and by sector the population age structure and population density as proxy for the degree of urbanization . This study also assesses whether the development dichotomy between more and less developed municipalities affects waste and recycling performances and to what extent the fiscal consolidation period influenced these processes . Empirical evidence validates the inverted U shaped relationship between municipal waste generation and overall production per head the U shaped relationship between recycling and waste generation as well as between recycling and the share of the tertiary sector . The municipal production structure is shown to be important for explaining waste generation and recycling behavior in contrast to population age structure that only differentiates recycling performance . It is also shown that the fiscal consolidation period affected positively the waste and recycling processes while population density and the development dichotomy are not relevant factors for explaining differences in waste generation and recycling activities across the Portuguese municipalities .",

Against this background this paper aims at estimating the mass of glass and carbon fiber reinforced plastic waste from rotor blades . To do so we derive material specific weight functions and material specific shares to calculate the amount of installed glass and carbon fiber reinforced plastics in rotor blades . We apply normally distributed lifetimes to project the calculated installed masses into the future and account for uncertainties within a simulation study . The estimation model is applied to a dataset of wind power plants within the European Union .

The deployment of MSW management systems is hindered by the ever growing generation of waste and the often insufficient infrastructure to manage process and dispose of waste . This paper presents a coordinated framework for complex MSW management systems . The framework accommodates multiple key stakeholders in MSW systems such as suppliers of waste consumers of waste and derived products and providers of transportation and processing services . Here the stakeholders submit bids to a coordinator that solves an optimization problem to determine allocations and clearing prices that maximize the collective profit for all stakeholders and that balance supply and demand for waste and products . Furthermore the clearing process guarantees that the individual profits are non negative . Notably the framework operates as a competitive market that accelerates transactions between stakeholders and that handles complex logistical constraints that would be difficult to handle in peer to peer transactions . The framework also facilitates the integration of policy incentives and the monetization of environmental impacts . In this regard we evaluate a tax applied to open dump disposal . To illustrate the applicability an MSW system in Mexico was analyzed as a case study . Results reveal that taxation can be used to incentivize the provision of services for all stakeholders .

        "Abstract":"The concept of biorefinery expands the possibilities to extract value from organic matter in form of either bespoke crops or organic waste . The viability of biorefinery schemes depends on the recovery of higher value chemicals with potential for a wide distribution and an untapped marketability . The feasibility of biorefining organic waste is enhanced by the fact that the biorefinery will typically receive a waste management fee for accepting organic waste . The development and implementation of waste biorefinery concepts can open up a wide array of possibilities to shift waste management towards higher sustainability . However barriers encompassing environmental technical economic logistic social and legislative aspects need to be overcome . For instance waste biorefineries are likely to be complex systems due to the variability heterogeneity and low purity of waste materials as opposed to dedicated biomasses . This article discusses the drivers that can make the biorefinery concept applicable to waste management and the possibilities for its development to full scale . Technological strategic and market constraints affect the successful implementations of these systems . Fluctuations in waste characteristics the level of contamination in the organic waste fraction the proximity of the organic waste resource the markets for the biorefinery products the potential for integration with other industrial processes and disposal of final residues are all critical aspects requiring detailed analysis . Furthermore interventions from policy makers are necessary to foster sustainable bio based solutions for waste management .",

        "Abstract":"Life Cycle Assessment is a widespread tool used to guide decision makers towards optimal strategic choices for sustainable growth . A key aspect of LCA studies of waste management systems where recycling activities are present is to account for resource recovery and the related substitution effects . Although multiple scientific papers assume a 1 1 substitution ratio between similar materials products this is often incorrect as the actual ratio is likely to vary . The focus of this paper is on the calculation of the substitutability coefficient for secondary materials based on technical characteristics . A state of the art literature review showed that many different calculation procedures were applied which led to a wide variety of substitutability coefficients . In this perspective the objective of this paper is to provide guidelines on the procedure to be followed to calculate the substitutability coefficient for secondary materials based on technical characteristics . These guidelines are then applied to two waste management case studies one dealing with bottom ashes from incineration and the other with plastic waste . In total sixteen technical substitutability coefficients are given for ten secondary materials based on state of the art and presented case studies . The paper thus represents a step forward in quantifying the substitutability of secondary materials in waste management LCA studies . The guidelines presented may allow other case studies to enrich the list of coefficients useful for all LCA practitioners in a harmonized way allowing a more correct evaluation of the environmental impacts associated with recycling activities .",

Increasing public awareness stricter legislation and large generation of MSW have led to high costs concerning related services . Therefore cities are starting to charge their citizens for the services provision and methods utilized vary significantly . They can range from a flat rate to the so named pay as you throw a proportional system in which the total amount varies according to the waste generated individually . In a scenario of little information regarding charging systems this research consulted academic material official websites and documents of the studied countries as well as national legislation in order to learn how countries with different characteristics charge their citizens for MSW management . It was observed a great variation in charging systems and prices usually the more developed a country is the more sophisticated it is in terms of charging schemes . Developed countries are ahead in terms of not only charging systems existence but also their type with a larger PAYT presence throughout their territories . Developing countries on the other hand still do not charge and or are struggling to universalize the charging since most municipalities still finance the service through general taxes . When utilized the charging method usually chosen is the flat rate for its simplicity of calculation and understanding . For improvements in charging systems it is necessary not only the presence of a legal framework but most importantly a greater maturity regarding SW management .",

To get deeper insights into its causes this study aimed at characterizing the odor of post consumer and recycled automotive polypropylene with different contents of talc and an anti fogging additive . Samples were evaluated by different sensory methods currently applied by the automotive industry which confirmed that they are not feasible for reuse in interior automotive applications . As these odor evaluations are usually performed by non trained panelists and do not allow a detailed description of the samples single odor qualities sensory evaluation according to ISO 13299 was performed by trained panelists . Samples showed mediumhigh odor intensities rated from 5.1 to 5.6 and a general dislike of the odor with hedonic ratings from 1.8 to 2.6 . Their odor profiles correlated well with the odorants identified by chemo analytical characterization using gas chromatographyolfactometry and two dimensional GC O coupled with mass spectrometry . An array of odorants with benzene and phenolic structures were identified as potential contributors to the samples overall smell and are likely to originate from degradation of additives commonly used in automotive components . While the addition of talc or anti fogging additive did not significantly improve the odor of the samples the description of the samples smell and the identification of odor active compounds related to it allow the development of avoidance strategies for the manufacturing of neutral smelling products intended for vehicles interior applications .",

        "Abstract":"Technology for the transformation of waste feathers to quality regenerated filaments has been developed . Regardless of superior properties of natural keratin materials previously developed regenerated materials from keratin had tensile properties much lower than their natural counterparts due to backbone hydrolysis and inefficient reconstruction of disulfide crosslinkages . In this work tough keratin filaments have been regenerated from white duck feathers via efficient restoration of disulfide crosslinkages using a dithiol reducing agent . Dithiol substantially reserves free thiol groups in the extraction and formed lengthy intermolecular crosslinkages in regenerated keratin filaments . Due to the high degree of intermolecular reconstruction of disulfide bonds and formation of lengthy crosslinkages via dithiol chain extension the keratin filaments exhibited considerable improvements in mechanical properties especially for ductility and water stability . The tenacity and elongation at break were 160.7MPa and 14 respectively . The filaments retained about 80 of the tenacity of natural feathers at either dry or wet conditions and demonstrated stretchability 150 higher than natural feathers . The fiber regeneration technology makes it possible to substitute primary fiber sources by renewable poultry feathers . Successful filament substitution or addition can bring more than 88 billion dollar revenue . The technology not only contributes to a sustainable fiber and poultry industry but adds substantial values to poultry feathers .",

First the bin location allocation problem is solved by selecting collection sites from a set of potential sites and determining the type and number of bins at each selected collection site . Second bin to bin waste collection routes are obtained for a fleet of homogeneous vehicles that are restricted by either work shift duration or vehicle capacity . Mixed integer linear programming models are proposed for both stages considering the particular characteristics of the problem . The models are applied to a real world instance in the commune of Renca in Santiago Chile . The results of first stage indicate an important preference for small bins since they have a lower unitary cost . Due to the large size of the real instance a Large Neighborhood Search heuristic is used in the second stage to find good feasible vehicle routing solutions in a reasonable period of time . The results for the routing phase suggest a larger number of routes in the morning work shift since these routes have shorter distances . The LNS heuristic presents a satisfactory behavior when compared to the MILP model with small instances . The proposed bin to bin household waste collection vehicle routing presents a more efficient solution than the existing door to door waste collection in the commune of Renca with respect to the total daily traveled distance and the average work shift duration .

This study focuses on the environmental impacts generated by packaging waste related to urban food delivery services . In particular the Python based web crawling and sample survey methods are used for big data mining and LCA based environmental impacts evaluation and Kernel density analysis methods are combined to determine the positioning trend of food delivery service providers and expansion direction of environmental pollution load in Jing Jin Ji region . Results indicate that food delivery service packages presently account for a very small proportion of municipal solid waste . However this study also evidences that food packaging accounts for 15.7 of the total MSW generated in this region . Even if this growing market sector might have a relatively low impact households lifestyle might affect the results . In terms of consumption quantity plastic bags are the most used packages accounting for 35.08 wooden chopsticks account for 32.21 and plastic boxes account for 27.43 . Among all environmental impact categories resulting from the process of production of packages greenhouse effect is the most distinct one . Paper boxes generate the most serious environmental pollution . The distribution of environmental pollution loads resulting from food delivery service packages positively correlates with the distribution of food delivery service providers in Jing Jin Ji . Shijiazhuang has the highest degree of pollution resulting from food delivery service packages with the interrupt value ratio of 80 followed by Baoding City and Chengde City which have the interrupt value ratios of 65.1 and 48.6 respectively . Finally as bridges between food delivery service providers and consumers food delivery service platforms should improve their environmental protection mechanisms .

An attributional life cycle assessment of the management of 1kg of surplus bread was conducted to assess the relative environmental impacts of alternative and existing waste management options . Eighteen impact categories were assessed using the ReCiPe methodology . The different management options that were investigated for the surplus bread are donation use as animal feed beer production ethanol production anaerobic digestion and incineration . These results are also compared to reducing the production of bread by the amount of surplus bread . The results support a waste hierarchy where reduction at the source has the highest environmental savings followed by use of surplus bread as animal feed donation for beer production and for ethanol production . Anaerobic digestion and incineration offer the lowest environmental savings particularly in a low impact energy system .

Nevertheless it remains challenging to develop the efficient while cost effective catalyst for the catalytic pyrolysis of tire . In this study the pyrolysis of tire scrap at 500C with the biochar produced from the gasification of poplar wood at 850C were conducted . The biochar catalyst significantly affected the evolution of the volatiles and the char properties while had a slight impact on the yields of the gas tar and char products . The biochar catalyst catalyzes the cracking of limonene a major liquid product in tar to form significantly more propane in gases and alkanes or alkenes in the tar . In addition the interaction between the biochar with the oxygen containing organics promoted the re condensation reaction which increased the oxygen content in the char but the biochar catalyst did not influence the evolution of the aromatics . Additionally the catalytic pyrolysis also makes the biochar catalyst more oxygen deficient and more resistant towards oxidation . Concluding all the results showed that biochar which were produced from the gasification of poplar wood can be a potential catalyst for the pyrolysis of tire .",

In this context the management of the OW treatment process to maximize agro system sustainability satisfying the crop nutrient demands represents the main goal . To investigate these traits two protocols to assess the plant availability of digestate nitrogen and phosphorus were evaluated . With this aim the N and P availability was determined on 8 digestates and 2 types of digestate based compost from different OW via sequential chemical extractions . In addition the digestates were tested in soil incubations and in plant pot tests with Italian ryegrass and compared with chemical fertilizer and a non amended control soil . The N extracted from digestates via SCE was related to soil N mineralization and plant N recovery . The C N ratio had negative impact on mineralized N and its recovery in shoots Shoots",

Several technologies for recycling IGCC slag have been developed thus far although the results obtained are not promising or universally applicable . We quantitatively characterized an IGCC slag by using various testing methods including an automated scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectrometry system to recognize its potential for recycling . The IGCC slag did not contain free CaO and the absence of free lime would address a concern of volumetric expansion during hydration . Automated SEM EDS analysis revealed that approximately 98 of the IGCC slag particles consisted of calcium rich aluminosilicate materials . Obvious differences in the concentrations of Si Al and Ca between the amorphous phases and the average chemical bulk were recognized . The chemical composition of the amorphous Si Al Ca phases was similar to that of Class C fly ash while the average bulk composition of the IGCC slag was in between that of Class C and Class F fly ashes . Considering this discrepancy understanding the dissolution mechanism of the reactive amorphous fraction as well as an exact assessment of the reaction products based on the role of Ca in alkali activated materials provides a new approach for the valorization of IGCC slag .",

During the process of treatment extractant is applied to the separation of hydrochar and bio oil . In this study three polar extractants and two nonpolar extractants were used and the physico chemical properties of hydrochar and the composition of bio oil were investigated . Compared with nonpolar extractants polar extractants could extract the bio oil absorbed on the hydrochar exterior and interior surface resulting in more mass loss of hydrochar and better extraction performance on the production of bio oil . The decrease of H C atomic ratio and the increase of O C atomic ratio indicated the demethanation tendency to occur during the extraction process and enhanced the hydrochar stability . The scanning electron microscope and specific surface area analysis revealed that polar extractant had a more positive effect than nonpolar extractant on the occurrence of disperse spherical microparticles and the augment of hydrochar specific surface area . The bio oil from polar extractant mainly consisted of N containing compounds ketones phenols and acids while the bio oil from nonpolar extractant mainly consisted of esters alkanes and aromatics .

For recovery of multiple metals such as Ca Fe Mg and Si and generation of value added products by dissolution and precipitation reactions in aqueous media enhancing the metal selectivity and extraction efficiency are important . However there is limited understanding of independent parameters that influence these important characteristics . In this work a systematic attempt was made to correlate these key dissolution characteristics of basic oxygen furnace slag in acidic media with its mineralogical and physical characteristics the changes in aqueous chemistry and the role of potential secondary precipitates . The findings from this study substantiate that steel slag is a potential feedstock because of the calcium being mainly present as orthosilicates which were found to leach congruently without forming a leached layer that might hinder calcium extraction . The leaching of Fe from the slag is the main source of impurity and its slow oxidation precipitation leads to a pH plateau at the end of the dissolution step . Oxidation precipitation of Fe is controlled by hydroxyl concentration in the aqueous solution which necessitates a pH swing step by addition of a base after dissolution . Use of surface complexing agents such as sodium molybdate can significantly reduce iron impurity in the leachate and obtain an iron rich slag residue for recycle to iron and steel industry .",

Iron leaching inhibitors promote selective calcium leaching in acidic media. Precipitation of silica on the slag surface was not observed gelation is likely."

This policy also applies to domestic ship generated organic waste . However little is known about the current state of ship generated organic waste management in the province of Quebec . This study aims to analyse the current situation and propose sustainable strategies for ship generated organic waste valorisation in Quebec . Using the available data it was attempted to estimate ship generated waste quantities in Quebec after which the current practices of domestic ship generated organic waste management in Quebec and Europe were inventoried along with international waste management practices . Five waste valorisation scenarios were then proposed and compared in terms of advantages and disadvantages required equipment and associated costs and revenues . It involves 1 composting on board of the ship 2 centralised composting 3 composting at the port 4 centralised biomethanation and 5 biomethanation at the port . The current available data on ship generated waste quantities in Quebec did however not allow selecting an optimal scenario . The information provided in this short communication can serve as a valuable basis to guide future research efforts and decision making in this regard .

It was found that under the estimated treatment quantity will generate in China in 20202034 the recovery cost per kilowatt of photovoltaic modules will be 25.11 USD the unit benefit is 25.68 USD kW and the unit net benefit is 0.57 USD kW . The net present value and benefit cost ratio are 21.14 million USD and 1.023 . The sensitivity analysis indicated that the sale benefits of recycled materials and tax were the most sensitive factors affecting the project s economy . Finally we proposed ways to improve the economy for the government and related enterprises .",
        "Highlights":"Economy of waste PV module recycling is discussed based on cost benefit analysis. The costs and benefits of PV overall recovery process are analyzed. Recovery of waste PV module will have a low economic potential in China. Fiscal policy and recovery strategy are provided for government and enterprises."

Theoretical calculations for suspension velocities of the current collectors and separators indicate that they could be separated under special conditions . Furthermore a special Z shaped pneumatic separator was used to separate the current collectors and separators for the first time . Experiments for manually cut samples indicate that the efficiency of pneumatic separation is approximately 100 with the sizes and airflow velocities in the range of 34cm and 6.967.8m s respectively . Furthermore industrial experiments of pneumatic separation indicate that the recoveries of the current collectors and separators are approximately 99.23 and 98.64 respectively . Computer simulations of the separation process indicate that the turbulence and the changes in high speed zones in the pneumatic separator benefit the separation of current collectors and separators . In conclusion pneumatic separation is a promising technology to separate crushed current collectors and separators .",

An important input for designing such processes is the metallic content of WPCBs which is assayed by grinding and leaching samples taken from the stack of WPCBs to be recycled . The content values come with substantial uncertainties arising mainly from the uneven distribution of the metals within the structure of WPCBs .",

        "Abstract":"Non hazardous industrial waste primarily consisting of manufacturing process residues has long been overlooked in waste reporting regulation and reuse . Limited information about NHIW generation with spatial and sectoral details has impeded the systematization of reuse efforts to move towards a resource efficient economy . In this article we develop a methodological framework that makes the best use of fragmented and limited observational data to infer the confidence intervals of NHIW generation by sector location and year across the United States . The framework decomposes the quantity of NHIW into two factors the activity level and the waste intensity factor . It statistically infers the probability distribution of the waste intensity factor and extrapolates waste tonnages to the entire country . In our demonstrative application of the method we provide an updated estimate for spent foundry sand and find that its total amount in the United States decreased from 2.27.1 million tons in 2004 to 1.44.7 million tons in 2014 . The spatial distribution however was highly uneven with over 90 of the waste generated in 10 of the counties indicating great variations in reuse potentials and benefits among regions . Our methodological framework makes a significant departure from existing estimations that usually rely on averaging limited observations or expert judgments biased by subjectivity . Detailing spatial and sectoral distributions and temporal trends in NHIW generation and reuse benefits our study could inform more systematic strategies on waste and materials management to build a circular economy .",

Two batch experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of the substrate mixing ratio and the initial pH on the acidogenic fermentation of SS with CW at different temperatures . The first batch experiment showed that a decrease of the SS proportion in the co digestion with CW led to a higher degree of acidification observing a synergistic effect at a SS CW mixing ratio of 25 75 . In the second batch experiment three temperatures and two initial pH were studied at SS60 CW40 and SS25 CW75 substrate mixing ratios . Maximum degrees of acidification of 56 and 73 were achieved at 50C and initial pH of 5.5 for the SS60 CW40 and SS25 CW75 substrate mixing ratios respectively . Finally the performance of a semi continuous reactor was demonstrated at laboratory scale reactor . Different hydraulic retention times pH and the effect of a thermal pre treatment of the SS was studied . The maximum degree of acidification in the lab scale reactor was 45 at 37C HRT of 20days and pH of 5.5 . Under these conditions the volatile fatty acids profile was dominated by butyric and acetic acids .",

To internalise the externalities associated with single use containers different instruments including a deposit refund scheme have been operationalised in many countries . Therefore DRS is introduced in Scotland to reduce plastic litters by increasing recycling rates and incentivising pro environmental behavioural change . This study addresses the complexity of single use plastic containers by analysing consumers perceptions regarding the introduction of DRS in Scotland . Using 940 comments from the BBC Have Your Say messageboard this study adopts sentiment analysis to understand consumers opinions about the introduction and implementation of DRS in Scotland . Findings suggest that a UK wide scheme that is similar in terms of operations and structure is required for DRS to be successful . While consumers knowledge and opinions about DRS are mixed the efficacy of DRS including its relevance is questioned and raises doubts about its contribution to sustainability . The findings imply the need for UK countries to negotiate and collaborate on appropriate and attractive interventions in addressing post consumer single use plastic containers . The implications of the findings for policy and practice especially in improving the operations of DRS are further discussed .",
        "Highlights":"Online platforms are now an effective tool for marketing and policy development. Consumers emotions and opinions are important for interventions to be effective. Clarity about DRS including its operations is required to enhance participation. A UK wide scheme with similar operations and structure should be introduced. DRS may not contribute to sustainability rather it might increase pollution."

In 2000 the city was divided in four zones with four separate solid waste collection contracts being awarded to private firms with none being allowed to obtain more than two zones a rule that was revised in 2009 to just one contract per firm . This division of the market via exclusive territories sought to enhance competition in the expectation of the convergence of relative costs efficiency and service quality throughout the city . This study analyzes and evaluates the creation of lots as a tool of competition with monthly observations of costs and outputs between 2015 and 2019 . Main findings are that firms producing in larger zones report higher costs that increased competition was not sufficient to lead to converging costs and that none of the firms operate under increasing returns to scale . Based on our results we recommend creating an additional zone . We further suggest that if a public firm managed one of the zones the regulator would obtain more reliable information on the service costs and technical characteristics thus increasing her capabilities as supervisor of the private firms delivering the service in other zones .",

In this study we applied lithostratigraphy loss on ignition grain size and pollen analyses to sedimentary sequences from Thale Noi which is located in the west coast of the Gulf of Thailand in order to reconstruct the regional environmental history during the 8.2 ka event . Our results based on sediment . This characteristics and pollen records indicated that the study area was likely to have flooded prior to c. 8300 cal . a BP . The fall in sea level coincided with a high precipitation inferred from grain size between c. 8250 and 8100cal a BP . The increased precipitation can be attributed to the strengthening of the northeast monsoonal rains in the western Gulf of Thailand . The timing of the sea level fall and strengthen stronger winter monsoon is consistent with the abrupt decrease in the temperature records emanating from the northern hemisphere . Subsequently we observed a sea level rise from c. 8100 to 7950cal a BP which potentially continued till c. 7650 cal . a BP . The possibility of coastal erosion was detected by a hiatus in the sedimentary sequences dated between c. 7950 and 7650cal a BP . Then a standstill of the sea level occurred from c. 7650 to 7100cal a BP . This transgression is suggested to have caused coastal erosion that resulted in a hiatus in the sedimentation process between c. 7950 and 7650cal a BP . Correspondingly fluctuations in the monsoon strength resulted in an overall decreased precipitation from c. 8100 to 7450cal a BP although punctuated wet intervals were observed at c. 7950 and 7575cal a BP .",

The results show that the heavy mineral assemblages are dominated by epidote followed by hornblende garnet and hematite limonite . In the Yellow River sediments the content of hornblende is higher than the epidote and the epidote to hornblende ratios are lower than the core YRD 1101 . The E H show two distinct lower values at depositional unit 42 and DU 41 to DU 2 indicating the obvious influence of YR sediments . The heavy mineral composition of DU 5 is distinct from YR sediments and interpreted as the result from heterogeneous provenance of the adjacent ancient rivers while DU 4 to DU 1 resemble the upper middle reaches of the YR sediments . The different sediment types of core YRD 1101 do not contain markedly different transparent heavy mineral assemblages in terms of concentration and mineral ratios . No matter how sedimentary environment changes the ratios of epidote and hornblende show very stable values in DU 41 and DU 3 due to the influence of YR sediments . The transparent heavy minerals such as hornblende epidote and other stable minerals which were relatively stable are controlled primarily by provenance while the sedimentary environment mostly influences the flaky minerals and the authigenic minerals .

Comparative dating studies that make use of several independent or semi independent radiometric techniques in tandem are an invaluable means of assessing the reliability of optically bleached quartz dating methods and ascertaining empirical relationships between different quartz dating signals . In this study we undertake a comparative dating evaluation of single grain TT OSL and various ESR signals that exhibit different optical resetting properties at the Middle Pleistocene archaeological site of Porto Maior northwest Spain which contains a distinctive regionally significant Acheulean stone tool assemblage . We expand the existing chronological framework for Porto Maior using single grain TT OSL dating derive combined numerical ages for individual depositional units using Bayesian modelling and further examine the relationship between ESR and TT OSL signals by reviewing a range of published comparative dating studies . The new single grain TT OSL ages obtained for unit PM3 at Porto Maior are in close agreement with previously published ESR TiLi ages for this unit and significantly younger than those reported for the Al centre . Our broader comparison of published TT OSL ESR dating results also shows statistically significant agreement between single grain TT OSL and TiLi centre ages in other sedimentary settings suggesting a potentially closer relationship between the TT OSL producing traps and the TiLi paramagnetic centres in quartz rather than between the TT OSL and Al centre signals .

        "Abstract":"There is extensive evidence for extraction of grease and fat from bones of ungulates at Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene sites in the Southern Levant . Excavations at Shubayqa 6 identified an area where extensive processing of carcasses took place during the transition between the Late Natufian to Early Pre Pottery Neolithic A . Large quantities of fire cracked basalt highly fragmented faunal remains and burnt bones indicate that grease and fat were extracted on a large scale . Spatial analysis demonstrates that bird remains were discarded in the same location where this fat rendering took place . Waterfowl dominate the assemblage and would have been present mainly in the winter . Body part representation of the bird remains suggests that this abundance of avifauna resulted in people selectively processing the carcasses of the wetland birds they hunted . Gazelles would have been in peak condition at this time of year with higher concentrations of fat stored in their bodies . This seasonal glut of resources contrasts with the summer especially late summer when most of the commonly hunted bird species were absent and the gazelle in relatively poor condition . People aware of seasonal cycles in resource abundance may have preserved foods when available . Storing fat conserves resources for leaner times . Compared to the Natufian site of Shubayqa 1 fewer young gazelle in the faunal remains at Shubayqa 6 is an indication that hunting either targeted mature animals or was more intense in the winter when fewer young animals are present . Carcasses from juvenile animals are comprised of less fat and the association of the adult gazelle carcasses with the bird remains suggests that the two resources were processed alongside one another . Preservation of foodstuffs for leaner months of the year may have been one potential outcome of this activity .",

These sites preserve abundant Mode 1 and Mode 2 lithic industries and are considered as among the oldest evidence of hominin presence in Western Europe north of the 45N latitude . Following a multi technique approach combining electron spin resonance single grain thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence dating of quartz grains and palaeomagnetism we obtained new chronological constraints for the sedimentary sequence and the associated lithic assemblages at the two sites . The new independent dating results derived from each method are consistent and in overall agreement with existing ESR and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide burial age estimates except for the Lowermost Unit 3at LTS . By integrating all of the previous and new dating results we derive combined age estimates of 772 735 ka and 66529 ka for the fluvial sands at LTS and BN respectively . These two distinct aggradation phases may tentatively be correlated to interglacial glacial transitions associated with Marine Isotope Stage 19 18 for the former and MIS 17 16 for the latter .",

Here the kettle holes are represented either as dry depressions wetland areas or lakes . However the majority of these features are silted and part of the present farmland . We investigated a small kettle hole at Tyrsted near the township of Tyrsted south of Horsens with the aim to determine the extension and depth of this feature using geophysical methods . A former excavation at Tyrsted carried out from the Horsens Museum in 2017at a neighboring site revealed Late Palaeolithic flint of the Bromme type and worked reindeer antlers . This connection in a Late Glacial horizon is unique not only in a Danish context and it can help to improve and clarify the dating of the Bromme culture . We used ground penetrating radar electromagnetic induction and electrical resistivity tomography to estimate the extension of the kettle hole . Shear wave reflection and refraction seismics were able to detect the bottom sediment of the former lake at about 5m depth . Furthermore a seismic event at about 1.30m depth is visible which can be associated to the transition between the Allerd and Younger Dryas sediment making the detection of the Bromme horizon possible . After the non invasive investigation a location for an open excavation has been chosen in a way to groundtruth the geophysical results allowing the direct comparison with the stratigraphy . These results allow the archaeologists to identify key excavation areas focused on the investigation of the Allerd and Younger Dryas layers in a way to improve the dating information about the Bromme horizon collected so far . Furthermore geophysical investigations together with excavations will enable the archaeological and palaeoenvironmental research groups to search large scale palaeolandscapes for these very rare but highly important finds .",

Hostile weather conditions and difficult approaches to access glaciers due to rough terrains largely limit observational studies on glaciers in the Himalaya . Sub alpine trees and shrubs close to glaciers growth of which is very sensitive to fluctuations in temperature provide precise continuous record on climate and glacier behaviour to supplement the observational records back to several centuries . To unfold the Gangotri glacier dynamics in the past we developed tree ring chronologies and studied the colonization pattern of the trees in the region . Tree ring chronologies of Himalayan birch and Himalayan pine developed from their respective upper tree line ecotone in the Gangotri glacier forefields showed impact of temperature on the growth variations . A comparison of Himalayan pine chronology with temperature proxies revealed regional and hemispheric scale temperature signal . Using tree ring chronologies we show expansion of the Gangotri glacier during cool phases that are also in agreement with the glacier fluctuation records from Central Asia and Southern Tibet . Moreover using tree colonization pattern in the glacier forefields we established for the first time that the Gangotri glacier terminus receded 1.853km since the late 16th century major part of which receded since 1935 C.E . The glacier retreat associated with the onset of 20th century warming got accelerated since 1957 C.E . .

        "Abstract":"Settlement distribution modelling assumes that human spatial behaviour can be revealed by using the correct set of variables . However the regional variables of large scale gradients are only considered rarely . Also settlement modelling applications are often impeded by fragmentary and error prone datasets . Thus in current day Lithuania in order to study the dynamics of settlement distributional rules we implemented a modelling strategy that involves the use of statistical and machine learning methods with null model simulations and that is less affected by the incompleteness of datasets and the scales of variables . In this study we used regional variables in order to test their usefulness while providing a general understanding of the large scale processes that governed settlement distribution in prehistory . This study encompassed six time intervals between the Palaeolithic and Iron Ages . The obtained results consisted of regional settlement predictive maps estimations of random forest variable importance and performances of GAM models as well as determinations of Besag s L functions of settlement patterns and Euclidean distances between the regional variables at the settlement sites . We detected decreasing spatial autocorrelation of the settlement prediction maps and settlement patterns declining variable importance and model performance as well as increasing regional environmental diversity of the settlement sites . A marked manifestation of these trends was observed between the Neolithic and Bronze Ages . This also corresponded to a major change in the constitution of the most important variables of the settlement distributions . We associate these findings with technological and lifestyle changes in the southern Baltic region interpreting them as causing a roughening of the human adaptive landscape increasing the specificity number and complexity of the settlement distributional rules . Our study revealed that even for incomplete datasets and spatial autocorrelation the application of advanced statistical machine learning techniques was able to provide new insights into the processes that governed the socio cultural evolution and spatial dynamics of humans in prehistory .",

Despite its exceptional mechanical strength UHPC still requires passive steel reinforcement to maximise its bending capacity and the overall material cost will be high . The basalt fibre rebar has a higher mechanical strength than steel rebar with lower cost . In addition it also has better alkali resistance and good cost effectiveness . The basalt fibre rebar is therefore considered as a potential alternative reinforcement in the structural member . In this study a recently developed UHPC formula was adopted the conventional steel rebar and basalt fibre rebar were used as reinforcement . The developed components were tested against static flexural and methane air explosion loads . In the four point flexural tests the basalt fibre rebar reinforced specimen performed more ductile structural behaviour with higher flexural strength . Two large scale methane air explosion tests were conducted in buried utility tunnels with different length . The experimental test in shorter tunnel yielded lower explosion pressure with marginal structural response . The test in longer tunnel achieved a higher explosion pressure on concrete elements .

Quasi static uniaxial compressive tests were conducted to comprehensively explore the effects of geometric factors and failure patterns on energy absorption capability . The experimental results revealed that the pristine FRP and CF Al hybrid tubes collapsed in a progressive failure mode and generated abundant intra and inter laminar cracks during crushing . The GF Al hybrid tubes with large diameters collapsed in an unstable and inefficient mode due to local buckling and delamination . Compared with bare aluminum tubes the specific energy absorption and crushing force efficiency of CF Al hybrid structures were improved significantly by respectively 54.3 and 40.4 for tubes with 40mm inner diameter . Furthermore the CFE of CF Al hybrid structures improved by more than 40 when compared to their bare CFRP counterparts though the SEA reduced by more than 5.5 .

However it is difficult to conduct multiaxial mechanical tests on foam materials especially under arbitrarily proportional triaxial loadings . In this study numerical modeling of the yield properties of aluminum foam is performed based upon 3D image based models . Real structural models of the Al foam are reconstructed using microscopic X ray computed tomography technique for multiaxial characterization computationally . Numerical simulation reveals that plastic collapse and fracture of cell walls first occur in a relatively weak zone under prescribed uni tri axial loadings whereas happen in the central section under biaxial loadings . An initial yield criterion is defined based upon energy dissipation . A constant stress proportion coefficient can be obtained under the stress controlled triaxial proportional loading and its effectiveness is also validated by comparing the stress strain responses with those under velocity controlled uniaxial and hydrostatic compressive loading . It is found that the initial yield points of foam specimens can be obtained in different stress states in the von Mises mean stress space . The normalized yield surface is approximately independent of relative density and can be well fitted to a parabolic or an elliptic function . Comparisons between the numerical yield surface and three typical theoretical yield criteria suggest that the Deshpande and Fleck s criterion provides more precise predictions than Gibson and Miller yield criteria when a proper plastic Poisson s ratio is adopted . Furthermore it is shown that the early stage yield surface of metallic foams can be evolved in a geometrically self similar manner .",

        "Abstract":"We produce balsa based structures by selective removal of lignin . The changes that occur in the main components of balsa upon delignification including tracheids closed pits and tylosis vessels allow the development of mesopores and a substantial increase in fluid permeability . Such system is ideally suited as a support of phase change materials PCM . Vacuum assisted impregnation with polyethylene glycol results in a form stable PCM system . The FPCM displays a high encapsulating capacity at temperatures above the melting PEG transition with a latent heat of 134J g and low supercooling . The results are rationalized by the affinity between the unidirectional mesoporous structure and the PCM polymer involving capillary forces and hydrogen bonding . The leakage proof FPCM outperforms available systems supported on minerals or other wood species . Compared to the latter group the results obtained with balsa relate to its morphology and the effect of residual hemicelluloses in hierarchically aligned cellulose nano and microfibrils . The FPCMs resist compressive loads and performs stably for at least 200 cycles of heating and cooling . An insignificant loss in latent heat is observed compared to that of pure PEG . The phase transition temperature fluctuation and non leaking characteristics under load make the balsa based FPCM a superior alternative for passive heating cooling especially for uses at high ambient temperatures . The reversible thermoregulatory capacity low cost high efficiency renewability and operability of the balsa supported FPCM indicate an excellent option for thermal energy storage and conversion devices .",

High PCM loading compressive strength and stability are obtained. The observed performance of the FPCM is partially explained by PEG affinity with the support.

This research presents two direct compression techniques for the ribs during wet filament winding with T700 continuous carbon fiber tows . In addition the strength of the helical rib manufactured using the proposed compression process was compared to that of the manufactured rib that did not use the compression process . The average compressive strength of the helical rib manufactured using the proposed methods is 394 Mpa and 247MPa according to the failure mode respectively . Although the ribs manufactured using the proposed method did not show increase in strength decreases in the standard deviation for both compressive failure modes and was observed . Thus the proposed compression techniques resulted in compression strength stabilizing thanks to decreasing void content . Furthermore structural stiffness was indirectly evaluated and it was found that the improvement was over 150 .",

Four different composites were considered to demonstrate the scope of the technique application with various combinations of weave matrix and fibre . A Digital Image Correlation system integrated with the hemispherical testing device validated that shear strain was the dominant strain in the failure region . From this work it is evident that shear failure morphology varies between the tested composites based on the differences in their weave architecture and fibre and matrix properties . Additional Finite Element Analysis showed that neither bending nor friction hindered the tests ability to produce pure shear in the specimen .

To address the problems of limited driving range and time consuming charging for BEBs manufacturers have developed rapid on route charging technology that utilizes typical layovers at terminals to charge buses in operation using high power . With on route fast charging BEBs are as capable as their diesel counterparts in terms of range and operating time . However on route fast charging makes it more challenging to schedule and manage charging events for a BEB system . First on route fast charging may lead to high electricity power demand charges . Second it may increase electricity energy charges because of charging that occurs during on peak hours . Without careful charging scheduling and management on route fast charging may significantly increase fuel costs and reduce the economic attractiveness of BEBs . The present study proposes a network modeling framework to optimize the charging scheduling and management for a fast charging BEB system effectively minimizing total charging costs . The charging schedule determines when to charge a BEB while the charging management strategically controls the actual charging power . Charging costs include both electricity demand charges and energy charges . The charging scheduling and management problem is first formulated as a nonlinear nonconvex program with time continuous variables . A discretizing method and a linear reformulation technique are then adopted to reformulate the model as a linear program which can be easily solved using off the shelf solvers even for large scale problems . Finally the model is demonstrated with extensive numerical studies based on two real world bus networks . The results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively determine the optimal charging scheduling and management for a fast charging BEB system which carries the potential for use in large scale real world bus networks .",

The barges depart from the dry port and visit a set of sea terminals where containers need either to be dropped off or picked up . The goal is to achieve economies of scale with barges and avoid trucking as much as possible . The decision thus involves finding the best allocation of containers to barges in order to guarantee on time delivery and meet capacity restrictions . The problem will be modeled as a variant of the split vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickups and deliveries coupled with time features . The model includes parameters that can be tuned to improve barge utilization and travelling distance . A hybrid local search meta heuristic algorithm combined with a branch and cut solver will be developed to solve the model . Numerical experiments have been conducted to test the performance of the algorithm and provide solution analysis for practical insights . Real world data has been collected from a local barge operator based in the Port of Rotterdam region and will be used as input for the experiments .

A platform based management approach can make reasonable use of parking slots by gathering the parking time windows of owners and consumers in advance . However the actual parking time is difficult to be consistent with that registered on the platform . Owners and consumers may be unpunctual when arriving and departing . The parking unpunctuality is a stochastic factor and affects the allocation of parking slots . This paper focuses on how to model and optimize the parking unpunctuality in the shared parking slot allocation problem . We formulate the parking probability function of consumers and owners in different time slots and transform the stochastic programming model into an expectation model . It is found that in a certain time slot the optimal number of idle parking slot reserved is related to the probability of unpunctuality as well as the number of cars registered to arrive and depart in the neighboring time slots . The numerical experiments indicate that when considering the parking unpunctuality the allocation is less compact the satisfaction of consumers is decreased especially when the supply is limited or the consumer demands are excessive .

An increasing number of designer brands are finding ways to cooperate with rental platforms rather than compete with them . We develop a stylized model to study the impact of business to consumer product sharing on luxury fashion brands . Specifically we consider a setting where a designer brand firm provides a luxury fashion product to a rental platform which can either purchase the product from the firm then rent to consumers or allow the designer brand firm to use its platform to reach the consumers directly with a commission fee . Our analysis reveals that the presence of a rental platform leads to two simultaneous effects a market expansion effect and a cannibalization effect . In the base model we show that the market expansion effect dominates the cannibalization effect . Therefore the designer brand firm can benefit from the appearance of a rental platform . Further our analysis reveals that the optimal choice between the wholesale and agency contract of the firm and the platform depends critically on two parameters the revenue sharing proportion and salvage value . We illustrate that when the revenue sharing proportion is relatively large and salvage value is relatively small both the firm and the platform benefit more under the agency contract . Moreover we illustrate the robustness of our main insights to consider the presence of different consumer segments consumers conspicuous behavior competition between rental platforms and two period rental setting .",

        "Abstract":"Optimizing the duration of delivery tours is a crucial issue in urban logistics . In most cases travel times between locations are considered as constant for the whole optimization horizon . Making these travel times time dependent is particularly relevant in real urban traffic environments as traffic conditions and thus travel speeds vary according to the time of the day . In this paper we review the literature on time dependent routing problems with a specific focus on benchmarks and performance criteria used to experimentally evaluate the interest of exploiting time dependent data showing the lack of studies on the impact of spatio temporal features of the benchmark on solutions . Hence we introduce a new benchmark produced from a realistic traffic flow micro simulation of Lyon city allowing us to consider different levels of spatial granularity",
        "Highlights":"The paper is about when it is worth using time dependent data for routing problems. The actual city distribution of sensors favors tours yield by constant costs. Constraints of precedence maximum loads reduce the interest of time dependency. Imposing time window constraints favor time dependent traffic data. This is also the case when the networks sensors cover more than 50 of the roads."

Accepted requests are not available for immediate dispatch they must be processed before they are loaded for delivery . Vehicle routes are updated dynamically and serve each accepted delivery request no later than the end of the service day .

In pick stations pickers pick the products from inventory pods and put them in customer bins . In such a robotic mobile fulfillment center pickers are constantly busy with picking customer orders and avoid non value adding activities such as walking to reach storage locations . To fulfill customer orders each robot needs to complete a sequence of missions and each mission includes a set of retrieval requests . We study the operational problem of scheduling a mobile robot fulfilling a set of customer orders from a pick station . The mobile robot needs to bring each pod from a retrieval location to the pick station and return the pod to a storage location . The objective is to minimize the total travel time of the robot which can be considered as a proxy for other objectives such a shorter lead time higher throughput and less capital investment . We formulate the basic problem as an asymmetric traveling salesman problem . We then extend the model by adding general precedence constraints to give different priorities to customer orders based on their urgency . We also study a variation of the problem where the pod can be stored in multiple alternative locations . In this case we model the problem as a generalized asymmetric traveling salesman problem . An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic is developed to efficiently solve real size instances . The method outperforms the heuristics commonly used in practice .",

This paper addresses a multi modal distribution network design problem with the aim of balancing the trade off between economic and environmental benefits . The distribution network that we consider includes both transportation with trucks and ships . We propose a new mixed integer programming model which decides the optimal design of the system i.e . how many ships of each type to use their corresponding routes and sailing speeds . It also suggests an optimal cargo flow through the maritime and road based network . We show how the MIP model can be used to provide decision support through a case study from the distribution of automobiles in India which has a vast coastline that can be used for maritime transportation . Environmental emissions from automobile transportation in India have been rapidly increasing in recent years with the fast economic development and it has become a major contributor to regional air pollution and road congestion . One possible way to ease these negative environmental consequences is to consider a modal shift where some of the automobile transportation from the production facilities located close to the coastline is replaced by roll on roll off ships . Our study shows that multi modal distribution is both environmentally friendly and economically beneficial especially if more industrial players can collaborate to create economies of scale .",

In this paper we develop a two period model to study pricing and package size decisions in a crowdfunding game where a creator sells perishable products to sequentially arriving consumers . Consumers are heterogeneous in their usages and valuations and they get utility by consuming products rather than owning them . The creator can choose to provide a product menu that contains two types of packages or only provide one type of package to match the consumers usages and valuations . The project would succeed only when the project target is achieved during the funding period otherwise the transaction would be canceled . We show that consumers usages and valuations have a large impact on deciding the creators optimal pricing strategy and project target regardless of whether the exogenous or endogenous package sizes are used . In addition market outcomes depend not only on the optimal pricing strategy but also on the optimal project target . Moreover the creator can benefit from providing two types of packages instead of one type of package . Finally the creator can strategically reduce the size of the large package and narrow the gap between the two packages to attract more funds .",

We explore their impact on the dynamic behaviour of production and distribution systems by studying key operational and economic metrics . In a three echelon supply chain we observe that the discount generally increases the Bullwhip Effect which especially harms the manufacturer . The discount also reduces the retailers purchase costs but increases its inventory and capacity related costs . A key trade off thus emerges which manifests itself through a U shaped relationship between the total cost and the discount acceptance parameter . In the light of this trade off we discuss how key factors should affect the retailers willingness to pursue the discount . We observe that managers that need to deal with tougher environmental conditions such as high demand uncertainty and long lead times should be less reluctant to increase orders up to the discount quantity . We also discuss in detail other valuable insights for professionals both from the perspective of sellers and buyers .",

The main difference between FL and some conventional supply chain financing strategies is the separation of ownership and the right of use of the equipment products . This paper studies a service supply chain that consists of a capital constrained downstream firm that provides service to consumers and an upstream firm that manufactures the equipment needed during the service process . The downstream firm has three alternative financing solutions including FL bank credit financing and trade credit financing . In this study game theoretical models are constructed to analyze and compare the optimal prices order quantities and profits in different financing scenarios . Results corroborate that FL outperforms other conventional financing strategies when the profitability of service provision is low or the premium revenue of the FL firm due to its better utilization of the equipment is relatively high . Moreover the preference of the downstream firm on alternative financing models might not be exactly consistent with that of the upstream firm or the supply chain system . Under some conditions the downstream firm prefers TCF to other strategies while the upstream firm and the supply chain system is better off under FL . Furthermore we extend our research to some general situations e.g . endogenous interest rate in BCF positive quantity of equipment endowed with the downstream firm and integrated union of the upstream firm and the FL firm .

This allows them to serve international destinations without the need to go through traditional gateway hubs so that they can compete with airline alliances relying on the traditional dual gateway or the so called dog bone networks . This paper proposes a stochastic optimization model to address the location choice issue of additional gateway airports with a consideration of the competition between airlines running traditional dog bone networks and hub and spoke networks in a liberalizing inter continental market . A two stage approach is adopted to model the effects of demand uncertainty . In the first stage the future passenger demand is not observable and thus airlines or airline alliances aim to maximize their own expected profit by choosing additional gateway airports from the set of candidate gateway airports pre specified by the regulator . In the second stage with the passenger demand observed and the gateway scheme fixed airlines determine their aircraft sizes and service frequencies to maximize their own profit and air passengers choose routes that minimize their own travel disutility . Based on a calibration of the demand dispersion parameters in elastic demand function the proposed model is applied to the China Europe aviation market which includes the inter continental international market and the associated Chinese and European domestic markets so that to ascertain the comparative advantages of different network configurations .

We developed a basic system in which commuters have two alternative travel modes driving alone in general purpose lanes or carpooling in HOV lanes . Under this assumption the HOV lane management with TCSs is formulated as a mathematical programming problem . We analyze the effects with respect to feasible TCSs effective TCSs and optimal TCSs respectively . We extend the basic system by considering regular carpoolers with the scenario of HOVs choosing GP lanes . Under this situation the HOV lane management with TCSs is formulated as a variational inequality problem . We further analyze the management effects of different TCSs . Numerical examples demonstrate system indicators with several typical states the impact of key parameters on TCS management performance and the feature of the extended system in typical scenarios .

        "Abstract":"The phenomena of the COVID 19 outbreak and the Arctic Iceberg melting over the past two years make us reconsider the impact our way of life has on the environment and the responsibility of business toward minimizing and potentially eliminating emissions . Increasing ship traffic in ports leads to the growing emission of air pollutants which influences the air quality and public health in the surrounding areas . The International Maritime Organization has adopted relevant regulations and mandatory energy efficiency measures to address ship emissions . To ensure the effective implementation of such regulations and measures air emission detection and monitoring has become crucial . In this paper a dynamic multitarget path planning model is developed to realize multi UAVs performing synergistic detection of ship emissions in ports . A path planning algorithm under a dynamic environment is developed to establish the model . This algorithm incorporates a Tabu table into particle swarm optimization to improve its optimization ability and it obtains the initial detection route of each UAV based on a minimum ring method . This paper describes a multi UAVs synergistic algorithm to formulate the path reprogramming time in a dynamic environment by judging and cutting the minimum ring . This finding proves the improved efficiency of air pollution detection by UAVs . It provides useful insights for maritime and port authorities to detect ship emissions in practice and to ensure ship emission reduction for better air quality in the postpandemic era .",

        "Abstract":"The crew pairing problem is one of the most important but challenging tasks for commercial airlines . However the operation environment of the aviation industry is highly volatile with diverse uncertainties . Flight flying time variability is an important disruption that usually causes deviations of flight departure arrival times from the schedule . Traditional crew pairing frameworks without considering flight flying time variability can generate pairings that are fragile to flight delays . However the impact of flight flying time variability on crew pairings is under explored . In this paper we propose two robustness enhancement strategies based on the consideration of flight flying time variability . Besides two robustness measurements are developed to construct two novel robust crew pairing models . One is time based while the other is number based . A customized column generation based solution algorithm is proposed . Computational experiments based on real flight schedules show that our new models can greatly enhance solution robustness at a price of an acceptable increase in operating costs compared with the traditional model . Besides extreme delay flights can be completely avoided in the proposed models . Moreover the solutions obtained from the time based model show higher resistance against the disruption of flight flying time variability with a lower operating cost than the number based model .",

The MAIRP is an NP hard problem more complex than the classical Inventory Routing Problem . Moreover it captures many features that can be found in real applications of a vendor managed inventory strategy . We introduce a hybrid exact algorithm to solve it in which several Mixed Integer Programming models are solved to explore the neighborhoods of a Variable Neighborhood Search scheme applied to the MAIRP . We design several neighborhoods that are based on the features of the problem . The impact of this hybridization is a faster convergence of the model and an accelerated resolution process with respect to a branch and cut algorithm applied to the regular MIP formulation .

Accordingly we formulate the problem as a one stage container slot allocation model and a two stage container slot allocation model respectively . Both of the two models are stochastic mixed integer quadratic programming models with chance constraints due to the involvement of dynamic pricing port congestion and uncertain demand .

To mitigate the effects of the gray market a luxury brand manufacturer may strategically select its sales channels to sell the product in both markets simultaneously in both markets sequentially or exclusively in the high price market . We derive the equilibria for each strategy and demonstrate that selling strategy can mitigate the negative the impact of gray market . The results further show that gray market is active only if the customers valuation discount for gray products is moderate and the gap between the customers perceived status valuation of the two markets is relatively large . As compared to the case without the gray market we find an interesting and counter intuitive result that gray market activity can mitigate the double marginalization effect and lead to a Pareto improvement for both the manufacturer and its retailer .

Acid zeolites like ZSM 5 convert methanol to dimethyl ether and water followed by the formation of olefins as well as of paraffins and aromatics as side products . In this study butene was used as model compound for the recycle in the industrial methanol to propylene process and co fed with methanol . During these kinetic experiments both methanol and butene inlet partial pressures were varied as well as the total volumetric flow rates . Temperatures between 708 and 788K were applied as the aim of this work is to model the fundamental kinetics of the MTO chemistry at olefin co feed conditions . For the kinetic model the single event methodology is used in order to reduce the number of estimated parameters while depicting each surface reaction . Olefin interconversion as well as olefin methylation and oxygenate interconversion steps are all covered by the model . Only the formation of aromatics is described in a simplified and thus not fundamental way . Over 4000 reaction steps are modeled using only eleven estimated parameters . The resulting high numeric significance of the activation energies allows a mechanistic analysis of the different reaction pathways and an assessment of the most important propene production steps . This shows high temperatures to be advantageous for fast carbon transfer to the olefin hydrocarbon pool and subsequent cracking of mainly hexenes and heptenes to propene .",

        "Abstract":"For flexible capacitive energy storage units in wearable devices areal metrics such as areal capacitance and energy density are exceptionally important because of limitations on device volume and weight . One dimensional carbon nanofibers composited with active metal oxides such as cobalt monoxide possess extraordinary electrochemical properties . However low areal metrics and the polarity in the flexible asymmetric supercapacitor device are two crucial challenges . Herein vanadium cobalt oxides on carbon nanofibers are purposely designed and fabricated by electrospinning and controllable post calcination which can be used as a binder free non polarity membrane electrode for the assembly of high performance flexible supercapacitor . Importantly the rational incorporation of vanadium with varying valence states helps promote the formation of CoO phase enriches the reaction sites and enhances the capability of local electron transport . As expected the single electrode of VCO CNFs yields an extraordinarily high areal capacitance of 1.83Fcm",

This cross sectional study included 1489 4 6 year old children residents of Kaunas city Lithuania . Responses to the questionnaires completed by parents were used to ascertain children s general and mental health . We estimated exposure to greenness by the normalised difference vegetation index and time spent in a park . We used multivariate logistic regression models to explore the independent associations between health outcomes and surrounding greenness and time spent in the nearest city park controlling for potential confounders . Of all the studied children 14 had poor perceived general health and 44.7 spent 5 or more hours per week in city parks . A significant increase in sedentary behaviour was observed in children with poor health . Every additional hour of time spent in parks was associated with decreased sedentary behaviour and a lower risk of poor health meanwhile lower residential greenness was associated with poorer mental and general health . Compared with NDVI 100m median and park use exceeding 5h per week lower greenness exposure and shorter park usage were associated with the risk of poor health and the general risk of mental difficulties in 46 year old children . Lower residential greenness levels and less time spent in a park were associated with poorer general and mental health among 4 6 year old children . Physical activity in green spaces is recommended as a measure to prevent poor general and mental health among children .",

Currently advanced maternal age and altered recombination patterns are the only well known risk factors for nondisjunction . Maternal occupation has not been investigated as a risk factor for maternally derived cases of trisomy 21 . This study explored the association between maternal occupation and chromosome 21 nondisjunction stratified by the stage of maternal error either Meiosis I or Meiosis II . Additionally we investigated specific toxic agents associated with occupation classes . Using narrative job descriptions from the National Down Syndrome Project a population based case control study occupation was coded using the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification . Odds ratios were calculated for the association between occupation class and having a child with DS stratified by meiotic stage . An exposure analysis was performed within occupational classes that were statistically significant predictors of having a child with DS . Odds ratios were calculated to analyze associations between individual exposures and having a child with DS . The odds of MII nondisjunction were increased among Production Workers . Women who worked as Life Physical and Social Scientists or in Food Preparation and Serving Related Occupations experienced greater likelihood of MI errors and OR 1.87 respectively . Exposure to solvents within the Production Worker group was a significant predictor for MI nondisjunction . No other environmental agents had a significant association with nondisjunction . Specific maternal occupation classes were associated with MI and MII chromosome 21 nondisjunction . These occupation classes were selected for an exposure analysis which determined solvents as highly predictive of MI nondisjunction among Production Workers . Findings from this analysis will serve to further explore the relationship between maternal occupation and chromosome 21 nondisjunction .",

In a panel study of 88 tree pollen allergy patients we analyzed self reported mental health perceived presence of allergenic trees near the residence and residential green space area within 1km distance and low green . Results were adjusted for patients background data and compared with distress in the general population . Short term distress was higher in the study population than in the general population . Residential green space had protective effects against short term distress low green per 10ha OR 0.85 .

This contamination stems from industrial discharges and the use of aqueous film foaming foams at military bases and commercial airports for drills and locations where fires occurred . Exposure to PFAS has raised significant public health concerns due to its persistence both in the environment and human body . The potential toxicity of these chemicals may pose risks to human health . Statewide biomonitoring data is needed to establish a baseline of exposure and to identify the subpopulations at risk . The NJ Department of Health conducted a statewide NJ Biomonitoring study for PFAS utilizing a cost effective sampling approach i.e . acquiring remnant sera from both clinical laboratories and blood banks across NJ . This convenience sampling approach was adopted as an alternative to a costly and labor intensive probability based population sampling . One thousand and thirty human sera were collected from NJ adults between 20 and 74 years of age from 2016 to 2018 with additional information of county sex and age . The serum collection was demographically and geographically dispersed across four seasons . Twelve PFAS analytes were measured for the specimens collected . The data were post stratified by county sex and age groups . Stratified individual sample weights were developed and used to estimate population means compare least squared mean differences and examine contributing variables . Geometric means and percentiles with 95 confidence intervals of the target analytes are presented providing preliminary baselines of the statewide PFAS exposure for NJ adults . PFOA PFNA PFHxS and PFOS were selected for in depth analyses because their GMs were greater than 0.5ng mL and they were detected over 99 in study population . Subjects from this study had higher serum levels of PFOA PFNA and PFHxS compared to the general U.S. population reported by the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey . However the distributions of PFOA PFNA PFHxS and PFOS across sex and age groups were consistent with the patterns found in NHANES i.e . all differed by sex and age group . Further sex and age stratification showed significantly lower concentrations of the 4 analytes in younger females than in older females and males . Future research is needed to identify PFAS exposure sources and to develop effective intervention strategies . Continuing PFAS biomonitoring using population sampling is recommended for tracking trends and better identifying subpopulations at risk .",

        "Abstract":"Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls in buildings constructed with PCB containing materials can lead to increased body burden of PCB for building users . Exposure to PCB from building related sources was assessed by measuring PCB in serum and hand wipes in two groups of tenants living in the same building estate in apartments constructed with and without PCB . The median serum levels of the sum of 19 PCB congeners was 777ng g lw for the exposed group and 282ng g lw for the reference group . The congener pattern in serum of the exposed was shifted towards lower chlorinated congeners and was dominated by tri and tetrachlorinated congeners . The largest difference in serum levels between the groups was observed for PCB 28 with median levels of the exposed being 70 times higher than in the reference group . For very persistent lower chlorinated congeners like PCB 28 66 and 74 an increase with residence times was observed as a result of accumulation over time . Less persistent congeners such as PCB 44 and 70 were also elevated in the exposed group but independent of residence time . The less persistent congeners can therefore be used as markers of recent exposure to original PCB sources . The hand wipes also showed a large exposure contrast e.g . PCB 28 being more than 60 times higher in the exposed group compared to the reference group and no overlap between the groups . All measured di to pentaPCB congeners were significantly higher in hand wipes from the exposed group compared with the reference group . Thus hand wipes seem to be a good non invasive screening tool for ongoing indoor exposure to PCB . Furthermore the measured level of PCB on hand wipes was significantly correlated to PCB in blood for almost all congeners . In conclusion PCB exposure in contaminated buildings can contribute significantly to the exposure and total body burden of PCB and the lower chlorinated congeners can make up the majority of the total PCB body burden .",
        "Highlights":"Indoor exposure can be the main contributor to the total body burden of PCB. Indoor exposure to PCB is reflected in serum samples after a few years of exposure. PCB 44 and 70 in serum can be used as markers of recent exposure to original sources. Hand wipes can be used for screening of recent PCB exposure indoors.

However limited cohort studies have investigated the relationship between time varying exposure to occupational noise and the development of hypertension . We conducted a 17 year cohort study involving 2459 workers to assess the relationship between time varying exposure to occupational noise and incident hypertension in the aerospace industry . We performed an extended Cox proportional hazard model considering occupational noise exposure as time varying covariates . Furthermore we employed the distributed lag nonlinear models to examine the exposure response relationship . In the extended Cox proportional model as workers were exposed to noise over 80 dBA the hazard ratios of hypertension significantly increased with a noise increase of 5 dBA . In exposure response associations the HRs of hypertension steadily increased between noise levels of 82 and 106 dBA . After additionally adjusting for personal protection equipment the HRs decreased dramatically between 107 and 124 dBA . Our study refined the exposure assessment by integrating time varying exposures to occupational noise and taking work history into consideration . Our findings suggested that workers exposed to noise levels between 82 and 106 dBA for 317 years may increase the risk of hypertension with a non linear exposure response pattern . We further provided evidence that workers wearing PPE could effectively reduce noise exposure and avoid the development of hypertension .",

Although pilot WSP projects in China were initiated shortly after WSP was introduced by the World Health Organization in 2004 they have yet to be used for water supply facilities at a large scale . To better understand the evolution of WSP application in China a systematic review was conducted to identify all published WSP related studies in China . Eighteen studies which included 311 water systems were included in the final analysis . Risk matrix water supply risk factors and other data were extracted and analyzed . Text mining methods were also used to better understand risks that can be addressed by WSPs . This study revealed a number of noteworthy differences between and among urban and rural water systems in China . The primary risks associated with most urban water supply systems tended to be related to mechanical failure s in the water treatment process . Rural water supply systems appear to suffer from similar problems but insufficient overall management capacity was more prevalent in rural systems . Overall the evidence suggests that to date the use of WSPs in China has been primarily limited to pilot studies and full implementation of WSPs in China appears to still be in the early stages . The paper closes with a summary of the key obstacles identified as well as a discussion of policies and technical options which could increase the use of WSPs in both urban and rural China . Among other recommendations the data indicate that there is strong need for the development and implementation of a simplified WSP approach designed specifically for small rural systems in China .",

This study focused on assessing potential health risks for humans exposed to concentrations of heavy metals in river systems that receive effluents from wastewater treatment plants in the Maluti a Phofung municipality . Untreated influents and treated effluents from two plants one in the town of Phuthaditjhaba the other in the town of Harrismith were analysed for heavy metals . Water samples were also collected from the Elands and the Wilge Rivers which receive effluents from the treatment plants in Phuthaditjhaba and Harrismith respectively . All samples were analysed for heavy metals Iron Magnesium Manganese Zinc Copper Chromium Nickel Lead Cobalt Arsenic Cadmium using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry . The probabilistic human health risk was estimated using the Total Hazard quotient and Monte Carlo techniques . The results showed that there was no significant difference between treated and untreated wastewater in the concentration of heavy metals for both wastewater treatment plants using the student T test . This indicated the inability of both treatment plants to remove metal contaminants adequately . Projections of non cancer risk for metals in river water samples indicated a high potential for non cancer risk for humans upon exposure via ingestion with Arsenic being a significant contributor to overall risk .

In this methodological structure we propose the use of different risk assessment tools at each step of DWSS which can be implemented in water systems of different sizes . The results of our study allowed the identification of hazardous events that may compromise the effectiveness of the WSP Of the 103 events found 16 were related to the catchment 40 to treatment processes 27 to the distribution system and 9 to consumers while the remaining 11 were associated with organizational planning contingency and emergency factors . We found that the most critical components of the DWSS are the distribution system and the consumers with 29.6 and 33.3 of the hazardous events classified as at a very high risk level respectively . Clearly improvement and support programs for the WSP were needed to optimize existing control measures and corrective actions and to evaluate new ones to reduce risk levels . The treatment processes and distribution system steps were shown as the main barriers of the DWSS mainly they are under governance of water company unlike the catchment and consumers which presented higher levels of risk because in these steps the water company has less control and influence . Our research confirms that the WSP is an important tool for decision making by water service companiesimproving their administrative financial organizational and operational management .

Some epidemiological studies have found that a prenatal excess of Mn could negatively affect neuropsychological development during infancy but the evidence is inconclusive . The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between maternal serum Mn concentrations and child neuropsychological development assessed at 1 year of age . study subjects were 1179 motherchild pairs from two Spanish cohorts of the INMA Project . Mn was measured in serum samples collected during the first trimester of pregnancy . Child neuropsychological development was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development composed of both mental and psychomotor scales . Sociodemographic lifestyle and dietary information was collected through questionnaires during pregnancy and during the child s first year of life . Serum Mn was log 2 transformed . Multivariable linear regression models were built . Generalized additive models were used to assess the shape of the relation between prenatal exposure to Mn and the neuropsychological test scores . geometric mean and 95 confidence interval of maternal serum Mn was 1.50 g L. Levels of Mn were higher among non working mothers and in those with a higher consumption of nuts . The association between maternal Mn levels and child neuropsychological development was negative in the multivariable models for the mental 0.39 and psychomotor scales 0.92 although the coefficients were not statistically significant . The best shape describing the relationship between Mn and the Bayley scales was linear in both cases . This study shows a null association between maternal prenatal levels of Mn and neuropsychological development at one year after birth in two cohorts within the INMA study .",
        "Highlights":"Prenatal Mn levels did not associate with neuropsychological development during the first year. Maternal iron status and the child s sex did not modify the Mn effect. Consumption of nuts was the only dietary factor associated with maternal Mn levels."

        "Abstract":"In most cases urban Wastewater Treatment Plants only partially abate pollutants occurring in the influent . Treated effluents can thus contain a complex mixture of ecotoxic pollutants such as heavy metals detergents disinfectants plasticizers pharmaceuticals residues or pesticides . In this context Ecotoxicological Risk Assessment provide essential decision making tools to public authorities for establishing environmental policies and conducting territorial planning . The present work aims to develop a territorial scale ERA methodology using two complementary approaches based on a Risk Quotient calculation the first based on the risk linked to each individual pollutant the second considering all pollutants present and the cocktail effect . This research was performed at 33 urban WWTPs of in a highly urbanized part of France . Initial minimum median and maximum pollutant concentrations in treated effluents were obtained from a literature review of physico chemical analysis studies to reconstitute typical effluents . The classical approach identified the riskiest substances and showed the risks for each WWTP . The mixture ERA approach revealed new risks which were not highlighted in the classical ERA approach thus increasing the number of WWTPs identified as at risk . This study shows the importance of accounting for the cocktail effect which is not considered in current regulatory decisions . Finally this methodology allowed us to identify the riskiest situations that could worsen in the context of climate change .",
        "Highlights":"Micropollutants are often not effectively removed and so released by the urban WWTPs. A territorial approach is essential to evaluate the risks linked to WWTP effluents. Ecotoxicological Risk Assessment ERA for the WWTPs of the Grand Lyon territory was carried out. Two different ERA approaches were used for WWTP risk assessment. Mixture ERA revealed hidden risks compared to the classic single substance approach."

Microbial source tracking assays may help to identify environmental routes of pathogen transmission although these assays have performed poorly in highly contaminated domestic settings highlighting the importance of both diagnostic validation and understanding the context specific ecological physical and sociodemographic factors driving the spread of fecal contamination . We assessed fecal contamination of compounds in low income neighborhoods of urban Maputo Mozambique using a set of MST assays that were validated with animal stool and latrine sludge from study compounds . We sampled five environmental compartments involved in fecal microbe transmission and exposure compound water source household stored water and food preparation surfaces and soil from the entrance to the compound latrine and the entrances to each household . Each sample was analyzed by culture for the general fecal indicator",
        "Highlights":"Sanitation is a pervasive and understudied challenge in crowded urban settlements. We applied microbial source tracking to understand routes of pathogen transmission. Human fecal microbes were common in soil and stored water but not source water. Fecal contamination was observed regardless of modifying conditions in households. Transformational changes are likely needed to prevent enteric disease transmission."

It is currently not known if tobacco consumption causes chromosomal damage in cervical cells and if age and the hormonal status have an impact on tobacco induced genetic instability in the cervix . We conducted a study with pre and post menopausal women smokers and never smokers . Smokers consumed 30 light medium cigarettes day and were matched with the non smoking group . Cervical cells were analyzed for induction of micronuclei which are caused by structural numerical chromosomal aberrations additionally other nuclear anomalies reflecting genomic instability and cytotoxicity were scored . Furthermore the frequencies of basal cells were recorded which reflect the mitotic activity of the mucosa . MN and other abnormalities were increased in both groups of smokers . The effects were most pronounced in postmenopausal smokers compared to premenopausal smokers . Also the number of basal cells was clearly enhanced in older women . Tar and nicotine had no detectable impact on chromosomal damage but a clear association with pack years was observed . Smoking increased chromosomal instability cytotoxicity and induced cell divisions in cervical mucosa cells of pre and post menopausal women . The effects were more pronounced in the latter group indicating a higher risk for diseases that are causally related to DNA damage .",

Efforts by the Government of India to comply with national and international regulations and improved standard operating procedures are expected to lower the exposure risk of the workforce to hazardous substances including asbestos . The current workers are likely to face lesser risks than did those exposed in the past . The present study assesses the health risks from past exposure of asbestos for those workers engaged in handling and removing ACM in ship recycling yards before environmentally sound recycling of obsolete ships was introduced in the early 2000s . Estimates were made of the number of workers exposed and the intensity of exposure and these data were used to estimate the likely number of mesothelioma deaths in the future . It was estimated that nearly 15 of the total workforce engaged in ship recycling will suffer from mesothelioma which translates to about 4 513 mesothelioma deaths among the total of 31 000 workers estimated to be ever employed in the yards from 1994 till 2002 . Recommendations are made for a practical approach to the safe handling of ACMs in Indian ship recycling yards .",
        "Highlights":"No previous study on cancer risk estimates due to asbestos exposure in Indian ship recycling yards have been reported. It is likely that airborne asbestos fibre concentrations in Indian ship recycling yards could have exceeded 100 fibres ml. Nearly 4500 mesothelioma deaths are likely to occur by the year 2027 due to improper asbestos handing at the yards. These deaths have mostly gone unrecorded. More deaths are projected to occur amongst bystander workers than those directly exposed to asbestos containing materials. Recommendations are made for the safe management of asbestos containing materials in Indian ship recycling yards."

Besides causing high mortality and morbidity diarrhoeal disease has also been associated with growth and cognitive shortfalls in children in low resource settings . Extreme weather events brought about by climate change may increase diarrhoeal disease and impact vulnerable populations in countries regardless of levels of development . We examined the seasonal and climatic influences of acute diarrhoeal disease reports in Singapore a city state located in Southeast Asia . We used a time series analysis adjusting for time varying potential confounders in a negative binomial regression model and fitting fractional polynomials to investigate the relationship between climatic factors and reported diarrhoeal disease . We included 1 798 198 reports of diarrhoeal disease from 2005 to 2018 . We observed annual trimodal peaks in the number of reports . Every 10 increase in relative humidity in the present week was positively associated with an increase in reports one week later 1.030 95 CI 1.0041.057 and negatively associated with a decrease in reports six weeks later . We observed effect modification of relative humidity on the risk of diarrhoeal disease in the first calendar quarter . There was weak evidence of a delayed effect of ambient air temperature on reports of diarrhoeal disease one week later . No threshold effects of climatic factors were observed . Each week of school holidays was associated with a 14.4 reduction in diarrhoeal disease reports . Public holidays were associated with a reduction in reports in the same week and an increase a week later . Diarrhoeal disease is highly seasonal and is associated with climate variability . Food safety and primary healthcare resource mitigation could be timed in anticipation of seasonal and climate driven increases in disease reports .",
        "Highlights":"Relative humidity was positively associated with the risk of diarrhoea. Seasonality was a major determinant of diarrhoea. Public and school holidays were associated with diarrhoea reports. Annual trimodal illness peaks suggest the importance of timing mitigation measures. Mitigation measures must include food safety and primary healthcare resource plans."

Several sources and routes of pathogen contamination of water resources have been identified including agriculture . Land spreading or disposal of manure livestock wastes is a notable source of public health relevant microorganisms into water . Microorganisms can be transported from manure amended soils into water from where they can reach animals and humans and may cause infection . This review explores the public health relevance of manure borne pathogens highlighting some of the diseases that manure associated pathogens cause . It also examines the dynamics of overland transport of pathogens into surface waters and percolation through soils into groundwater . Factors that influence the survival and transport of pathogens into respective water resources are discussed . The actual number of pathogens shed pathogen release rate requisite flow conditions precipitation characteristics and pathogen inactivation potential are some general factors examined in this review . Pathogen adaptation and survival in the soil environment is extensively discussed because soils significantly influence pathogen transfer into water . In addition to soil characteristics environmental variables such as moisture temperature and pH as well as soil biology are relevant aspects considered herein . Manure and farm management practices such as manure source and type storage and treatment also influence the occurrence survival and transport potential of pathogens . Optimized and recommended manure treatment techniques like composting which has been demonstrated to satisfactorily inactivate enteric pathogens in manure are discussed . The need for proper composting by observing recommended manuring stipulations is emphasized and finally practical strategies to protect water resources from pathogenic contamination are elucidated .",
        "Highlights":"Livestock waste is a reservoir for public health relevant pathogens. Improper management of manure may constitute a major public health hazard. Fecal contamination of water continues to be a major cause of transmission of many clinically relevant pathogens to humans. Depending on survival and transport conditions manure associated pathogens could be disseminated into the water. To minimize environmental impacts proper manure management is necessary."

Pediatricians measured the anofourchetal distance in female children and anoscrotal distance in male children . The anogenital index was defined as the AGD divided by the child s weight at age of examination . We measured the levels of two hexachlorocyclohexane isomers hexachlorobenzene dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites six polychlorinated biphenyl congeners and six polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners in maternal serum at 12 gestational weeks and in cord blood serum . Anthropometric and parental sociodemographic variables were collected via face to face interviews .

Over the past two decades many areas within New York City have undergone a transition from industrial and manufacturing land use to residential housing . This can bring new residents to areas which contain the legacy of historic Pb contamination . The objective of this study was to evaluate the difference in soil Pb concentrations between community parks and greenspaces in areas undergoing rapid redevelopment and land use changes and stable areas without redevelopment . Three high and three low risk Pb contaminated areas within NYC were identified based on an additive index that included population growth industrial land use and new construction . Soil samples were collected across 34 parks and analyzed with an XRF with a subset also analyzed by ICP MS. Areas within NYC evaluated in this study with a high risk index had significantly larger mean concentrations of Pb in soil and double the rate of children under the age of six years with BLL 5ug dL compared to low risk areas . There was a statistically significant positive correlation between street density manufacturing industrial land density and population density change within 0.40 km of a park and soil Pb concentrations . However we were unable to estimate the source specific contribution of Pb concentrations in soil since many of the variables assessed were correlated with one another . Regardless of the source large population increases are occurring in areas with elevated soil Pb levels .

An epigenome wide association study with exploratory pathway analysis may help identify potential pyrethroid related health effects . We performed an exploratory EWAS of chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure using control participants blood in the Parkinson s Environment and Genes Study in the Central Valley of California . We estimated associations of living and working near agricultural pyrethroid pesticide applications in the past 5 years with site specific differential methylation and used a false discovery rate cut off of 0.05 for significance . We controlled for age sex education cell count and an ancestral marker for Hispanic ethnicity . We normalized methylation values for Type I II probe bias using Beta Mixture Quantile normalization filtered out cross reactive probes and evaluated for remaining bias with Surrogate Variable Analysis . We also evaluated the effects of controlling for cell count and normalizing for Type I II probe bias by comparing changes in effect estimates and p values for the top hits across BMIQ and GenomeStudio normalization methods and controlling for cell count . To facilitate broader interpretation we annotated genes to the CpG sites and performed gene set overrepresentation analysis using genes annotated to CpG sites that were associated with pyrethroids at a raw p 0.05 and controlling for background representation of CpG sites on the chip . We did this for both a biological process context using missMethyl and a disease set context using WebGestalt . For these gene set overrepresentation analyses we also used an FDR cut off of 0.05 for significance of gene sets . After controlling for cell count and applying BMIQ normalization 4 CpG sites were differentially methylated in relation to pyrethroid exposures . When using GenomeStudio s Illumina normalization 415 CpG sites were differentially methylated including all four identified with the BMIQ method . In the gene set overrepresentation analyses we identified 6 GO terms using BMIQ normalization and 76 using Illumina normalization including the 6 identified by BMIQ . For disease sets we identified signals for Alzheimer s disease leukemia and several other cancers diabetes birth defects and other diseases for both normalization methods . We identified minimal changes in effect estimates after controlling for cell count and controlling for cell count generally weakened p values . BMIQ normalization however resulted in different beta coefficients and weakened p values . Chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure is associated with differential methylation at CpG sites that annotate to a wide variety of disease states and biological mechanisms that align with prior research .

Because the coronavirus can transmit through droplets and aerosols facemasks and N95 respirators that require complex certification are urgently needed . Given the situation the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that in settings where facemasks are not available healthcare personnel might use homemade masks for the care of patients with COVID 19 as a last resort . Although aerosols and droplets can be removed through the fibers of fabrics through a series of filtration mechanisms their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail . Moreover there are a series of non medical materials available on the market such as household air filters coffee filters and different types of fabrics which may be useful when facemasks and respirators are not available . In this study we comprehensively evaluated the overall and size dependent filtration performances of non medical materials . The experiments were conducted under different face velocities to study its influence on size dependent filtration performances . The flow resistance across these filter materials is measured as an indicator of the breathability of the materials . The results illustrate that multiple layers of household air filters are able to achieve similar filtration efficiencies compared to the N95 material without causing a significant increase in flow resistance . Considering that these air filters may shed micrometer fibers during the cutting and folding processes it is recommended that these filters should be inserted in multiple layers of fabrics when manufacturing facemasks or respirators .",

While Indonesia has a solid policy framework the country ranks third globally in terms of numbers of people practicing open defecation . Our aim was to assess the effectiveness of a five year strategy to reduce open defecation through accelerating implementation of the national sanitation program across districts receiving variable levels of external support . Among three provinces with poor sanitation program performance districts were selected to receive one of three levels of external support . High intensity districts benefitted from enabling environment strengthening support including political and social mobilization direct capacity development and efforts to strengthen planning budgeting monitoring and supervision learning districts benefitted from cross district learning opportunities and political mobilization through provincial government advocacy efforts and comparison districts were monitored under routine program conditions . Outcomes included open defecation free status and new toilet facility construction and were assessed through village level monitoring systems across all districts . Negative binomial regression and multivariate analysis were used to assess associations between levels of intervention intensity and outcomes . Among districts receiving high intensity external support improvements in political commitment planning coordination financing monitoring and supervision were observed . Relative to comparison districts high intensity districts were more likely to be ODF with greater increase in household toilet coverage .

        "Abstract":"Hand hygiene is an efficacious behaviour to prevent community associated infections . Estimates of the proportion of populations who wash their hands have indicated limited compliance . While biases of self report items for hand hygiene such as the tendency to overestimate one s behaviour represent a limitation direct survey questions remain important . This study aims to compare indices of handwashing compliance based on single vs. combined handwashing attributes i.e . its frequency technique and duration . Data of a representative survey on hygiene and infection control by the German Federal Centre for Health Education were analysed . In a cross sectional computer assisted telephone interview design the resident population in Germany aged 1685 years was surveyed in 2012 . For handwashing duration frequency in different situations and technique were self reported . Self reports were rated as compliant based on national recommendations and combined into single and multi attribute indices . Use of hand disinfectants recall of handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms and socio demographics were also assessed . In total N 4483 persons participated . Data were weighted to compensate for sampling bias and analysed by cross tabulation and multiple logistic regression . Primarily due to missing data the analysis was confined to N 4093 respondents . Among women the proportion of those who reported to wash hands almost always in at least seven of nine situations was 30.8 . In contrast 51 of men reported always using soap drying hands and washing interdigital spaces . Compliance based on indices that included frequency was higher in women by 5.2 for frequency technique and 2.5 for frequency duration and frequency duration technique . Socio demographic differences were most consistent regarding higher compliance among healthcare workers . Finally especially men recalling handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms had higher compliance than those with no recall namely for frequency technique all three attributes and technique . The highest odds ratio was noted for disinfectant use among men . While being representative for Germany limitations include the survey s cross sectionality response rate and the study representing the situation in 2012 . Nonetheless indices based on combined attributes allow better comparison to scarce compliance estimates for Germany based on observation . Socio demographic differences add to existing evidence e.g . higher compliance by healthcare workers . Finally although reverse causation is possible it is notable that although handwashing instruction plates in public restrooms focus on duration and technique women recalling them reported higher frequency and men more often report hand disinfectant use suggesting possible carry over effects . Self reported handwashing compliance assessment may be improved by partitioning the behavioural domain into different attributes and using indices based on combinations of these .",
        "Highlights":"As population handwashing compliance remains sub optimal self report measures remain useful despite over reporting biases. Self report indices based on combinations of different behavioral attributes may improve self report measures. Combined indices of frequency technique and duration come closer to observation based estimations than single indicators. Among socio demographic characteristics working in healthcare has most consistent positive associations with handwashing. Associations of recalling handwashing instruction with handwashing frequency and disinfectant use suggest carry over effects."

Prevalence of NSS and psychological morbidity were assessed for the year 2017 based on electronic health records from 39 general practices in the Netherlands . The study group consisted of people who lived in rural areas with high numbers of livestock while the control group included people in rural areas with low numbers of livestock . For a large portion of the study group exposure estimates were calculated . Multiple logistic multilevel regression analyses were performed . Two methods were used 1 area comparisons between study and control areas in relation to health problems and 2 estimates of livestock exposure within the study area . It was found that prevalence of diarrhea headache sleep disturbance respiratory symptoms and skin problems were higher in the study group . The data suggest that there may be a protective effect of livestock exposure in general there was a lower risk of NSS closer to livestock . The study suggests that the previously identified higher risk of respiratory health problems in livestock dense areas might also apply to the prevalence of various other NSS . Longitudinal research taking into account different or more individual and contextual characteristics could possibly elucidate why prevalence of NSS in closer proximity to livestock is lower compared to people who live further away whilst a more overarching analysis indicated that living in livestock dense areas was associated with more NSS .",

Early exposure of these children to mercury methylmercury and lead was assessed during lactation at 312 months old as well as their mother s exposure using measurements from a cross sectional study . Only infants who failed to pass the neurodevelopment screening tools and or had elevated mercury were included in this study . Urine and hair were sampled during the follow up study to assess the children s recent exposure to mercury methylmercury and lead . Their cognitive performance and visual motor integration were also measured using the Test of Non Verbal Intelligence and the Beery Visual Motor Integration respectively . The association between alterations in urinary porphyrins excretion and exposure to metals was analyzed and their influence on the children s neurodevelopment was explored . Linear regression models revealed a significant negative association between the infants mercury exposure during lactation and the TONI Quotient and Beery VMI Age Equivalent scores at age 58 . The mothers blood methylmercury was inversely and significantly associated with their children s TONI Quotient . In contrast the children s Beery VMI Age Equivalent scores were positively and significantly associated with the hair methylmercury of the mothers and their infants . These relationships suggest the presence of negative confounding that we did not take into account . Unlike mercury there was some evidence that lead in breast milk had an inverse relationship with the children s visual motor coordination skills . Our study did not show a clear association between children s recent exposure to metals and neurodevelopment . However a significant inverse association was observed between the TONI Quotient and the interaction of hair methylmercuryporphyrins implying that porphyrins are a sensitive measure of low body mercury burden . Although lead induced higher porphyrins excretion in urine their interaction did not influence children s neurodevelopmental scores . The interactions between metals and porphyrins might provide insights into their potential contributory role in the pathogenesis associated with neurological disorders or other diseases . Despite the small sample size of the present study its findings about the association between toxic metal exposure and the high risk of poor neurodevelopmental performance are worrying particularly at an early age and additional research is needed using larger sample sizes .",

It represents an attractive target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancers . The plant natural product glycyrrhizin is a well characterized ligand of HMGB1 and a drug used to treat diverse liver and skin diseases . The drug is known to bind to each of the two adjacent HMG boxes of the non glycosylated protein . In cells HMGB1 is N glycosylated at three asparagine residues located in boxes A and B and these N glycans are essential for the nucleocytoplasmic transport of the protein . But the impact of the N glycans on drug binding is unknown . Here we have investigated the effect of the N glycosylation of HMGB1 on its interaction with GLR using molecular modelling after incorporation of three N glycans on a Human HMGB1 structure . Sialylated bi antennary N glycans were introduced on the protein and exposed in a folded or an extended conformation for the drug binding study . The docking of the drug was performed using both 18 and 18 epimers of GLR and the conformations and potential energy of interaction of the different drug protein complexes were compared . The N glycans do not shield the drug binding sites on boxes A and B but can modulate the drug protein interaction via both direct and indirect effects . The calculations indicate that binding of 18 GLR to the HMG box is generally reduced when the protein is N glycosylated vs. the non glycosylated protein . In particular the N glycans in an extended configuration significantly weaken the binding of GLR to box B . The effects of the N glycans are mostly indirect but in one case a direct contact with the drug via a carbohydrate carbohydrate interaction was observed with 18 GLR bound to Box B of glycosylated HMGB1 . For the first time it is shown that N glycosylation one of the many post translational modifications of HMGB1 can affect drug binding .",

Both similarity and dissimilarity concepts are of great importance during the search for new active compounds . Similarity is important due to the assumption that underlies the process of searching for new drug candidates structurally similar compounds should induce similar biological response . On the other hand we are also interested in dissimilarity as we usually aim to find structurally novel ligands . In the study we compared several approaches of evaluating compound similarity . Various representations and metrics were applied and we indicated the rate of variation of the results that can occur when shifting from one strategy to another . We compared both general similarity of datasets using different approaches as well as examined the changes in the set of nearest neighbors when changing one compound representation into another and the influence of representation metric settings on the clustering outcome . We hope that the study will be of great help during the preparation of virtual screening experiments stressing the need for careful selection of the way the compound similarity is assessed .

        "Abstract":"The 3D characterisation of individual vine canopies with a LiDAR sensor requires point cloud classification . A Bayesian point cloud classification algorithm is proposed that combines an automatic filtering method and a classification method based on clustering to process LiDAR data . Data were collected on several grape varieties with two different modes of training . To evaluate the quality of the BPCC algorithm and its influence on the estimation of canopy parameters it was compared to an expert manual method and to an established semi automatic research method requiring interactive pre treatment . The results showed that the AFM filtering was similar to the expert manual method and retained on average 9 more points than the PROTOLIDAR method over the whole growing season . Estimates of vegetation height and width that were obtained from classification of the AFM filtered LiDAR data were strongly correlated with estimates made by the PROTOLIDAR method R",
        "Highlights":"An automatic LiDAR Bayesian point cloud classification method BPCC was developed. BPCC combines a filtering and a partitioning algorithm to process a LiDAR point cloud. BPCC estimates canopy dimensions at the scale of an individual vine. BPCC canopy estimates were highly correlated with non automated reference methods.

A total of 900 kernels were used with 3 treatments namely each 300 kernels inoculated with AF13 AF36 and sterile distilled water as control separately . One hundred kernels from each treatment of 300 kernels were incubated for 3 5 and 8 days to obtain diverse samples . Based on the full mean spectra extracted from the same kernel side the best mean overall prediction accuracies achieved were 96.3 for the 3 class classification and 97.8 for the 2 class classification using the partial least squares discriminant analysis method . The 3 class and 2 class models using the full mean spectra extracted from different kernel sides had the best mean overall prediction accuracies of 91.5 and 95.1 . Using the most important 30 55 and 100 variables determined by the random frog algorithm the simplified type I RF PLSDA models achieved the mean overall prediction accuracies of 87.7 93.8 and 95.2 for the 2 class discrimination using different kernel sides information .

Studies about the consequences of using these configurations are often not conclusive since auxiliary elements and dimensions vary between filters . Here computational fluid dynamics simulations were carried out comparing underdrain designs in filters with equal sized diffuser plates and same inlet inner and outlet diameters . Seven underdrain pod type designs were analysed ranging from a market model to one with more than 50 of pods . Designs with equal number of pods but with different spatial distributions were investigated . Two wand and two spike type underdrain models were also evaluated . The main variables analysed were pressure and volumetric flowrate . Results confirmed that the flow uniformity through the filter was crucial to achieve low pressure drop values . Pressure losses through the sand were the most important contribution to the filter pressure drop for all cases . The water only region at the inlet had low relevance in terms of pressure losses . All underdrain designs had similar pressure drops at the exit collector chamber or pipe . Pod type designs with the same slot open area as wand and spike type configurations clearly had a better efficiency since wand and spike type designs had faces opposing the incoming flow . Pod and spike type designs with similar horizontal projected upward slot areas behaved alike in both filtration and backwashing modes with a better performance for the spike type configuration . Recommended spike type designs should cover most of the filter cross sectional area .",

In particular damage to greenhouses caused by heavy snowfall continues to occur on farms in South Korea . Because heavy snowfall occurs over a relatively long time compared to other sudden meteorological disasters if an appropriate warning system for heavy snowfall events is in place then damage to greenhouses can be prevented . However the existing snowfall warning system in South Korea consists only of a simple alert that is unable to anticipate future risks to an area caused by heavy snowfall . In this study the aim was to develop a stochastic alarm model to minimise the damage to greenhouses caused by heavy snowfall events . A Markov chain was designed to construct the alarm model using snowfall data from nationwide weather stations as well as from greenhouse standards with various safety criteria . The snow depth data were divided into several sections using a cluster analysis and the failure probabilities of the greenhouses were derived for specific time interval according to current snow depth . This method considers the weather characteristics of each region as well as various greenhouse standards because the risks of heavy snowfall vary depending on location and type of the installation . Using the alarm model developed in this study it is possible to predict and therefore manage the negative impacts of heavy snowfall events on greenhouses .",

However these factors are crucial for animal welfare and influence animal behavior . A comprehensive online survey was conducted among 573 German speaking ferret owners to gain insight into these aspects of husbandry the occurrence of behaviors potentially indicative of good or impaired welfare and associations between environmental conditions and ferret behavior . To reduce reactance in participants a forced choice answer format was avoided therefore the sample size varied . Ferrets were on average 3.3 2.3 years old . 56 were male and 44 were female . 89 of the male and 83 of the female ferrets were neutered . Many ferrets enjoyed good health . Most ferrets were not diagnosed with a ferret typical illness . A high percentage of animals were housed in a dedicated ferret room or unconfined in the flat or house . The vast majority had various enrichment items in their main living area . Potential stressors and welfare issues were also identified recent bite injuries from other ferrets ferret typical diseases such as cardiac disease and adrenal tumors or recent signs of ill health such as diarrhea or parasites and potential problem behaviors which might strain the human animal relationship such as defecation outside the toilet area . The mean age of the latest deceased ferret was 5.8 2.6years hinting at a shorter life span than often predicted .

The LSP resonance between NP NS has been predicted to be the most important effect on SERS which is dominant stable and can maintain the SERS intensity even at a relatively low NP coverage . If a slight deviation of AuNPs away from their original periodic positions was permitted a disordered model was then constructed which would more closely approximate the real AuNP NS hybrid structure and was able to calculate the influence of disorder on LSP resonance . A blue shift of the resonance peak was observed and its peak intensity would increase first and decrease then with the increase of NP NP spacing .

        "Abstract":"In this work we introduce a four green light wavelength splitter device based on six slot waveguide structures . Silica and gallium nitride materials were chosen for confining the green light inside the slot waveguide area in a transverse magnetic field mode . The device functioned as a 1 4 demultiplexer which demultiplexes wavelengths in the green light band with wavelength range of 500530 nm with an accurate spacing of 10 nm . The coupling between the six slot waveguide units was analyzed using the classical mode theory and the full vectorial beam propagation method . Simulation results showed that the four wavelengths could be demultiplexed after a short coupling length of 106.5 m with low losses around 0.1080.127 dB full width at half maximum around 8.999.39 nm and excellent crosstalk around 21.13 to 24.1 dB . The device has the potential to increase data bitrate by utilizing the wavelength division multiplexing technique in visible light communication systems .",

To overcome identification concerns we use the US Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 which increased the maximum limit of deposit insurance coverage leading to significant changes in the proportion of insured deposits to assets of some banks while leaving others relatively unaffected . In line with the view that dividends convey information regarding financial health we find that banks which experience a substantial increase in insured deposits reduce dividends relative to others with a smaller increase in insured deposits . An extensive battery of further tests confirm that our results are not driven by events that took place around the time of the increase in the maximum limit of deposit insurance coverage . Overall the results of our empirical analysis suggest that banks holding fewer uninsured deposits pay less dividends .",

In a multi dimensional setting including the main price leaders within futures perpetuals and spot markets the CME futures have a very minor effect on price discovery even less than the spot exchanges Bitfinex Bitstamp and Coinbase .

By making use of the linearized fluid equations coupled with Maxwells equations the dielectric tensor and the dispersion relation of excited modes are derived . Since the electron motion is considered relativistic and fluid theory of plasma is used to describe the system the obtained results are applicable to a vast range of high energy density regime . The mutual interaction between EM and Electron Plasma Waves is studied numerically . In the absence of the axial magnetic field the EPWs and the Extraordinary Electromagnetic waves interact due to the existence of the self generated magnetic field . The instability caused by this interaction has already been reported . We found that applying an axial magnetic field will cause deflection to plasma oscillations which enables coupling between EPWs and Ordinary Electromagnetic waves as well . The results show that increasing the external magnetic field strength suppresses the growth rate caused by the coupling of EPWs EOEM and passes it to the growth of EPWs OEM . Therefore by adjusting the external magnetic field strength the growth of EOEM and OEM modes can be controlled .",

To avoid overlapping i.e . overestimation of the number of etch pits for each energy region a correction method for the energy spectrum from the number of etch pits was developed .

The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database from 2010 to 2015 was queried to obtain cases of patients with liver metastases at the time of primary cancer diagnosis . The primary cancers with an incidence rate of liver metastasis 0.1 are presented in this analysis . Among 2.4 million cancer patients 5.14 of cancer patients presented with synchronous liver metastases . The most common primary site was breast cancers for younger women and colorectal cancers for younger men . As patients get older a more heterogenous population of the top cancers with liver metastases emerges including esophageal stomach small intestine melanoma and bladder cancer in addition to the large proportion of lung pancreatic and colorectal cancers . The 1 year survival of all patients with liver metastases was 15.1 compared to 24.0 in those with non hepatic metastases . Regression analysis showed that the presence of liver metastasis was associated with reduced survival particularly in patients with cancers of the testis prostate breast and anus and in those with melanoma . The most common primary sites for patients with liver metastases varied based on age at diagnosis . Survival for patients with liver metastasis was significantly decreased as compared to patients without liver metastasis .",
        "Highlights":"5.14 of primary cancer patients from 2010 to 2015 presented with synchronous liver metastases. The most common primary sites with synchronous liver metastase were breast and colorectal cancers. The primary site was more varied in older patients with synchronous liver metastases from gastrointestinal melanoma bladder and lung cancers. Survival for patients with liver metastasis was significantly decreased as compared to patients without liver metastasis."

        "Abstract":"Unhealthy food environments may be associated with higher risks of developing diet related cancers such as colorectal cancer . We conducted an ecological analysis to evaluate the relationship between the local food environment and colorectal cancer incidence overall and separately for males and females . Data from the Texas Cancer Registry was utilized to geocode individuals aged 40 years and older diagnosed with colorectal cancer from 2005 to 2015 to their residential 2010 census tract . Total number of establishments classified as Limited Service Restaurants for each census tract was retrieved from the 2005 Business Patterns Survey by using a crosswalk to map zip codes to census tract . Census tract unhealthy food availability was calculated by dividing the estimated number of Limited Service Restaurant establishments in each census tract by the census tract population and divided into quartiles . Generalized estimating equations were used to assess the association between unhealthy food availability quartiles and colorectal cancer incidence . Adjusting for the census tract level sociodemographic characteristics the incidence of colorectal cancer was slightly higher in unhealthy food availability quartile 2 1.03 95 CI 1.001.05 but not quartile 3 and quartile 4 compared to census tracts with lowest unhealthy food availability . Colorectal cancer incidence was not strongly associated with census tracts with higher unhealthy food availability . Future observational studies should be conducted to examine the influence of the built environment on colorectal cancer risk .",
        "Highlights":"Unhealthy food availability was weakly associated with colorectal cancer incidence. Higher rates of poverty were associated with higher colorectal cancer incidence. Research should examine how the built environment influences colorectal cancer risk"

We assessed contemporary gender race and stage specific incidence and trends of RCC among young adults in the United States . Within Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database patients aged 2039 years with histologically confirmed RCC were included . Age standardized incidence rates were estimated . Temporal trends were calculated through joinpoint regression analyses to describe the average annual percent change . From 20002016 7767 new RCC cases were recorded . ASRs were higher in males than in females and increased significantly in both genders . Non Hispanic American Indian Alaska Native had the highest incidence vs. non Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander the lowest . ASRs significantly increased in all ethnic groups . T1aN0M0 and T1bN0M0 stages showed the highest incidence and increase . Also regional and distant stages increased . The most frequent tumor characteristics were G2 and G1 as well as clear cell histology . RCC in young adults is rare but increasing . This is mainly due to T1aN0M0 tumors . Nonetheless also regional diseases are significantly increasing . Differences between ethnic groups exist and may warrant further research .",
        "Highlights":"Kidney cancer incidence rates in young adults are extremely low. Incidence varies across ethnic groups which may be related to different prevalence in risk factors and in genetic and environmental factors. Incidence is significantly increasing over time. The highest increase is occurring in T1aN0M0 tumors suggesting a possible ascertainment bias. The highest and the lowest socioeconomic status quartiles showed similar increase. Also higher stages showed increasing incidence. Different access to medical care and over diagnosis of small renal masses may not explain at all kidney cancer rising incidence in young adults."

The incidence of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia varies between countries likely as a result of competing risks including infections access to care socioeconomic influences and or ethnicity . However little is known about disease burden in high income Arab countries offering free of charge healthcare . The hypothesis was that due to population characteristics the incidence of cALL in Saudi Arabia is equal or higher than that observed in high income Western countries .",

Incidence rates in Bangkok were derived as the mean annual number of new cancer cases per 100 000 inhabitants for the period 20112015 stratified by 5 year age group and sex . Age standardized incidence rates were calculated using the world standard population . The five most frequent cancers in Bangkok correspond to close to 60 of the total burden in both males and females . In males cancers of the lung liver and colorectum each comprised 1416 of the burden while breast cancer was responsible for three in 10 cancers in women with colorectal and cervical cancer ranking second and third . respectively . Under three different scenarios of trends in all cancer incidence rates demographic changes mean that the incidence burden will rise over the next two decades . The critical relevance of this information in the context of the planning and evaluation of national cancer control policies in Thailand is discussed . Evidently the Bangkok and other Thai population based cancer registries are essential in measuring the population level impact of tobacco control HBV and HPV vaccination cervical and colorectal cancer screening and via survival estimation the effectiveness of cancer care .",

        "Abstract":"Infection is hypothesised as a contributory cause of childhood immune cell malignancies . Although some have reported associations between individual infections and immune cell malignancies some could be spurious due to infections caused by malignancies that were already active prior to diagnosis . Identified from Taiwan Cancer Registry 3000 children with four commonest immune cell malignancies diagnosed during 20012015 at age 120 years were identified and matched with 1 10 controls . Using logistic regression we estimated the time specific case versus control odds ratios of seven common infection presentations in their health records . We also compared recorded unexplained lymph nodes between cases and controls to explore for how long malignancy may be active prior to diagnosis . Unexplained lymph nodes were increasingly recorded months before the diagnosis of childhood leukaemias and years before the diagnosis of childhood lymphomas . When using p 0.01 as a guide large case control differences in infection records were found mostly within 02 months prior to the diagnosis . Changes in odds ratios within 335 months and case control differences beyond 36 months prior to diagnosis was relatively small . Statistical power varied according to incidence of malignancy incidence of infection records and the age distribution . Immune cell malignancies were likely to be active some time before the diagnosis . Previous studies using conventional population based methods may not be able to distinguish any small causal link between infection and immune cell malignancies from spurious associations .",
        "Highlights":"Associations between individual infections and childhood immune cell malignancies have been reported. Some associations may be due to infection caused by malignancies already active prior to diagnosis. Guided by unexplained lymph nodes we found malignancies could be active years before diagnosis. We also found increase in multiple infection presentations prior to malignancy diagnosis. In all most apparent associations could not be largely attributed to infection as a cause of malignancy."

        "Abstract":"To monitor trends in childhood cancer mortality in Europe . We calculated age standardized mortality rates per 100 000 children from 1990 to the last available calendar year for all neoplasms and six main cancers in childhood in selected European countries and geographic areas plus the European Union using data from the World Health Organization database . We carried out a joinpoint regression analysis of mortality trends for all neoplasms leukaemia and tumours of the nervous system . Results of the joinpoint regression were summarized through annual percent change for each identified linear segment and weighted average APC over the whole period . From 1990 to 2015 childhood total cancer mortality rates dropped by 2.8 per year in the EU to reach 2.6 100 000 in the latest available calendar years . The greatest declines were in central eastern countries . Recent rates ranged between 1.7 and 4.3 deaths 100 000 with the highest values in central eastern Europe . Leukaemia mortality rates in the EU decreased from 1.6 to 0.6 100 000 in the latest calendar years . The deepest declines were registered in central eastern countries though they still showed the highest rates . The lowest leukaemia mortality rates were in northern western Europe but also in the Czech Republic and Poland . Southern European countries showed comparatively high rates . Nervous system tumours showed relatively modest falls . Childhood cancer mortality continued to decline steady in Europe though geographic differences persist . Further efforts are required to fill the gap by promoting widespread and rational adoption of currently available treatment protocols .",

Factors influencing these time delays and correlation between these time points with variables including socioeconomic strata educational level histopathology location of tumor and the initial modality of treatment were assessed . A prospective analysis of patients with esophagogastric cancer presenting to a single tertiary care unit over a period of 12 months was performed . Histopathology other than adenocarcinoma and squamous cell were excluded . 202 patients were enrolled in the study . Most patients presented with advanced disease i.e . 91.5 of esophageal and 90 of gastric malignancies belonged to either stage 3 or stage 4 as per American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor node metastasis staging system . The median delay from the appearance of the first symptoms to initiation of treatment was 15 weeks . Patient related factors contributed to a significant delay . Administrative factors were responsible for median delay of 3 weeks . Curative multimodality treatment was administered in 62.5 of patients . Significant longer delay was influenced by socioeconomic strata educational level evaluation by non specialist . No relationship was noted between histopathology location of tumor or initial modality of treatment . Delays in our setting is much more than that is seen in Western and even some Asian countries .

        "Abstract":"There are reports that lung cancer in non smokers is increasing in the United Kingdom and other high income countries but evidence from large scale cohort studies to support this claim is limited . Using The Health Improvement Network IQVIA Medical Research Data we identified a cohort of 3 679 831 people from the UK self reporting to their primary care physician as never or non smokers . We estimated age adjusted incidence rates for recorded lung cancer before and after the introduction of smoke free legislation using multivariable Poisson regression . We also explored the impact of geographic location social deprivation and urbanicity . The analysis included 3 212 lung cancer events and 28 million person years . Between 1998 and 2007 the age adjusted rates in men declined by 9 per year from an estimated 5.6 to 1.5 per 10 000 PYs and by 3 per year between 2008 and 2018 . These trends for men were similar across sociodemographic strata . Between 1998 and 2007 age adjusted rates were stable for women at 1.5 per 10 000 PYs . However there was evidence that time trends for women differed depending on levels of social deprivation with rates increasing by 5 per year from an estimated 1.32.1 per 10 000 PYs for women living in the least socially deprived areas . Sex specific time trends from 2008 to 2016 were broadly similar in a separate cohort of self reported never smokers from UK Biobank with cancer events linked to national registries . In summary the incidence of LCINS has reduced or remained stable for most of the UK with the possible exception of women living in the least socially deprived areas .",
        "Highlights":"This study of 3.7 million people was prompted by concerns that lung cancer in non smokers LCINS is increasing in the UK. Using a cohort approach we could account for the increase in never smokers over time as well as the aging population. Our results suggest that the incidence of LCINS over the past twenty years has reduced dramatically in men and remained fairly stable in women."

This descriptive retrospective study reviewed all cancer cases recorded in the Bugando Cancer Registry a clinical and pathology based registry at the only cancer referral hospital in the region . Primary tumor site method of diagnosis HIV status and cancer treatment were reported . Using census data the 2012 GLOBOCAN estimates for Tanzania were scaled to the Lake Zone and adjusted for 2016 population growth . These estimates were then compared to BCR cases using one sample tests of proportion . A total of 2772 cases were reported from 20082016 . Among these the majority of cases were diagnosed among adults . Most cases were diagnosed by histology or cytology . Among adults the most common cancers diagnosed were cervix breast and prostate . Among children the most common cancers were non Burkitt non Hodgkin lymphoma Burkitt lymphoma and Wilms tumor . The 1116 BCR cases represent 12.2 of the 9165 expected number of cancer cases for the Lake Zone . 1494 cases received some form of treatment surgery chemotherapy radiation or hormone therapy while 1278 cases had no treatment recorded .

We examined the health lifestyles and social circumstances of adults with and without a history of cancer . We performed a cross sectional study using exposure and outcome data from the baseline survey of participants in the 45 and Up Study a prospective cohort study in New South Wales Australia . We compared 20 811 cancer registry verified adult cancer survivors with 207 148 participants without a history of cancer using propensity score weighting and accounting for multiple testing . The propensity weighting included age sociodemographic factors and number of self reported co morbidities . Cancer survivors were more likely to report poorer physical and psychological health and quality of life compared to those without a cancer history with most deficits still evident more than 10 years after cancer diagnosis . Cancer survivors were more likely to have a higher body mass index but were less likely to smoke . Cancer survivors had greater functional limitations including sexual and were less likely to work full time volunteer and spend time outdoors . Their social connectedness was however similar . Those with haematological cancer lung cancer or distant metastases and those diagnosed at an older age had the greatest health deficits and functional limitations . A history of cancer is associated with poorer health and less paid and unpaid work .

        "Abstract":"Determining the validity of self reported data is important . The aim of this study was to assess the validity of self reported cancer and investigate factors associated with accurate reporting in men and women . Study participants from the Geelong Osteoporosis Study located in south eastern Australia were utilised . Self reported cancer data were compared to Victorian Cancer Registry records . Age socioeconomic status education and time between cancer diagnosis and study appointment were investigated as factors associated with accuracy of self report . There were 142 participants who self reported a cancer and 135 with a VCR record . Comparing self report to any registry record sensitivity was 63.7 specificity 96.5 PPV 60.6 NPV 96.9 and overall agreement 0.588 . Comparing exact match records sensitivity was 58.8 specificity 95.5 PPV 49.3 NPV 96.9 and overall agreement 0.499 . In logistic regression models post secondary education was independently associated with accuracy of any and exact match self report compared to cancer registry record . For any cancer being aged 70 years was inversely associated with accuracy . Likewise for matched cancer reporting those aged 6070 years and 70 years were less accurate . No other significant associations were detected . Results suggest moderate agreement between self report and registry data for any cancer among men and women . However when comparing self report to registry data for exact match cancer type level of overall agreement deteriorated . Self report cancer data may be acceptable for determining a history of cancer although is less accurate in identifying history of specific cancer types documented in registry based data .",
        "Highlights":"Moderate agreement was observed between self report and registry data for any cancer among men and women. Agreement deteriorated when cancer cases were matched by ICD 10 classification. Overall agreement was poor for Melanoma. Women recorded lower sensitivity specificity and PPV for self report of any and exact match cancer compared to men. Education was associated with better accuracy of self report data and older age was associated with poorer accuracy. Self report cancer data is less accurate in identifying history of specific cancer types documented in registry based data."

        "Abstract":"Peru has a public health problem because of asbestos imports . We analyzed the mortality trends for mesothelioma in Peru and its provinces from 2005 to 2014 and estimated their relationship with the amount of asbestos imported previously . We computed age standardized mortality rates per 100 000 population and the standardized mortality ratio . The relationship between the amount of asbestos imported annually along the period 19652010 and the number of mesothelioma deaths per year from 2005 to 2014 was estimated by log linear Poisson regression models and Pearson correlation calculations . After correcting the number of deaths Peru registered 428 cases between 2005 and 2014 . The highest ASMRs were in Arequipa and Callao followed by Huancavelica . This translates into approximately one death per each 68111 of asbestos tons imported . The latency period for the higher level of positive correlation found was 8 years . Male female sex ratio was lower in provinces such as Junin and Hunacavelica with geological asbestos risk . Two patterns of mesothelioma risk have been detected occupational and environmental . During the 20022006 years Peru increased the asbestos use . If crocidolite imports were also increased this could be behind the 8 years latency period detected . Peru should boost strategies towards the total ban of all forms of asbestos .",

However it is not a sufficient cause given the high prevalence of transient infections . We examined the relationship between exposure to tobacco smoke measured using urinary nicotine metabolite concentrations and p16 Ki 67 co expression in cervical smears and subsequent risk of developing CIN2 CIN3 lesions in HPV positive women . This prospective longitudinal study enrolled women presenting to colposcopy with cytological abnormalities LSIL ASCUS at the National Maternity Hospital Dublin . Women gave a urine sample which was used to perform the Nicotine Metabolite Assay . HPV positive cervical smears were stained by immunocytochemistry for p16 Ki 67 . Two year follow up data including histological diagnosis was collected for each woman . Crude and adjusted odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression to investigate associations between tobacco smoke p16 Ki 67 positivity and CIN2 CIN3 . In total 275 HPV positive women were included . Women with nicotine metabolite concentrations above 500 ng mL indicative of smoking were classified as smokers . Smokers were at an increased risk of testing positive for p16 Ki 67 and CIN2 and CIN3 in compared to non smokers . In p16 Ki 67 positive women smoking further increased their risk of CIN2 CIN3 .

If these inequalities were mainly due to differences in stage at diagnosis population based screening programs might reduce them substantially . We aimed to determine to what extent adverse stage distribution contributed to survival inequalities in a Spanish region before the implementation of a CRC screening program . We analyzed data from a population based cohort study that included all patients living in a region of southern Spain with CRC diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 . The European Deprivation Index was used to assign each patient a socioeconomic level based on their area of residence . The role of tumor stage in survival disparities between socioeconomic groups was assessed using a causal mediation analysis . A total of 2802 men and 1957 women were included in the study . For men the adjusted difference in deaths between the most deprived and the most affluent areas was 131 deaths per 1000 person years by the first year after diagnosis . Of these deaths 42 were attributable to differences in stage at diagnosis . No socioeconomic disparities in survival were detected among female patients . In this study we mainly detected socioeconomic disparities in short term survival of male patients . More than two thirds of these inequalities could not be attributed to differences in stage at diagnosis . Our results suggest that in addition to a screening program other public health interventions are necessary to reduce the deprivation gap in survival .",

Therefore we assessed the risk of cancer among children with and without birth defects by age at attainment . We examined cancer risk in children 14 years with and without birth defects born between 1996 and 2011 by linking data from the Arkansas Reproductive Health Monitoring System Arkansas Central Cancer Registry and birth certificates . Age of attainment for cancer was calculated as person years from birth to cancer diagnosis death or end of study period whichever occurred first . Using Cox proportional hazards models we evaluated associations by attained age groups between groups of birth defects and any cancer non chromosomal birth defects by organ system and any cancer and non chromosomal birth defects and subtypes of cancer . In the cohort of 629 086 children 23 341 children had birth defects and 1 037 children had cancer . For children with non chromosomal birth defects specifically cardiovascular and genitourinary highest risk of any cancer was observed in first year of life 18.5 95 confidence interval 10.1 33.8 .

Analysis was conducted using a population based cancer registry cohort of Queensland residents aged 5089years diagnosed between 19972016 . Flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate LOLE by area level SES and accessibility for all invasive cancers and the five leading cancers . The gain in life years that could be achieved if all cancer patients experienced the same relative survival as those in the least disadvantaged high accessibility category was estimated for the 2016 cohort . For all invasive cancers men living in the most disadvantaged areas lost 34 of life expectancy due to their cancer diagnosis while those from the least disadvantaged areas lost 25 . The corresponding percentages for women were 33 and 23 . Accessibility had a lower impact on LOLE than SES with patients from low accessibility areas losing 04 more life expectancy than those from high accessibility areas . For cancer patients diagnosed in 2016 an estimated 101 387 life years will be lost . This would be reduced by 19 if all patients experienced the same relative survival as those from the least disadvantaged high accessibility areas .

Our study aims to analyze how these key metrics have evolved over time in the Azores Portugal . Data for incident cases diagnosed in 19972016 and followed up through December 31 2017 were obtained from the Azores Cancer Registry . Data for cancer deaths that occurred in 19912016 were obtained from Statistics Portugal . To estimate temporal trends we applied a joinpoint model to age adjusted rates . We estimated five year net survival within the framework of relative survival using the Pohar Perme estimator and predicted the number of cases and deaths in 2025 . In men incidence and mortality decreased for stomach larynx and prostate cancer . In women mortality decreased for breast and cervical cancer . Five year relative survival improved for several cancers with the most pronounced improvements for prostate cancer in men and colorectal cancer in women . Conversely incidence and mortality increased for colorectal cancer in men and lung cancer in women . The incidence and mortality burdens are both expected to increase in 2025 . Overall progress against cancer in the Azores has been mixed and much of the progress has been driven by advances in treatment .

Reducing tobacco use and tackling the obesity epidemic are the two public health priorities for cancer control within the region .",
        "Highlights":"This is the first study in which incidence survival and mortality are interpreted concomitantly to evaluate progress against cancer in a specific region of Portugal the Azores archipelago. Much of the progress has been driven by treatment advances as seen by survival improvements and decreases in mortality. Incidence and mortality increased for colorectal cancer in men and lung cancer in women. Reducing tobacco use and obesity are cancer control priorities within the region."

        "Abstract":"Outdoor artificial light at night has been implicated in a growing number of adverse health outcomes . ALAN is believed to disrupt circadian rhythms and has been associated with increased inflammation one of the hallmarks of cancer . We examined the association between outdoor ALAN and a cancer strongly associated with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions non Hodgkin lymphoma in the prospective California Teachers Study cohort . Outdoor ALAN was assigned to participant addresses at study baseline through use of the New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness . Among 105 937 women followed from 1995 to 2015 linkage to the California Cancer Registry identified 873 incident cases of NHL . Age stratified Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals for overall NHL and the most common NHL subtypes diffuse large B cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma . Multivariate analyses adjusted for previously reported subtype specific covariates for DLBCL . Compared to the lowest quintile participants residing in the highest quintile of outdoor ALAN at baseline were more likely to develop NHL and in particular DLBCL . The elevated risk for DLBCL remained statistically significant after adjusting for age race ethnicity BMI and socioeconomic status . There was no association between ALAN and FL or CLL SLL . DLBCL risk was elevated among women residing in neighborhoods with greater outdoor ALAN . Future research in circadian disruption and DLBCL may clarify potential biological processes implicated in this association .",

We evaluated the associations between GI and GL with lung cancer . The analyses were performed using data from a population based case control study recruited between 1999 and 2004 in Los Angeles County . Dietary factors were collected from 593 incident lung cancer cases and 1026 controls using a modified food frequency questionnaire . GI and GL were estimated using a food composition table . Adjusted odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals were estimated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders . Dietary GI was positively associated with lung cancer . For histologic subtypes positive associations were observed between GI and adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma . No clear association between GL and lung cancer was observed . These findings suggest that high dietary GI was associated with increased lung cancer risk and the positive associations were observed for both lung adenocarcinoma and small cell lung carcinoma . Replication in an independent dataset is merited for a broader interpretation of our results .",

In this study we analyzed the relationship between socio economic deprivation and cancer mortality . We focused on lung colon prostate and breast cancers in nine European urban areas over three periods two before and one after the onset of the 2008 financial crisis . This is an ecological study of trends . The units of analysis were small areas within nine European urban areas . We used a composite deprivation index as a socio economic indicator . As a mortality indicator we used the smoothed standardized mortality ratio calculated using the hierarchical Bayesian model proposed by Besag York and Molli . To analyze the evolution of socio economic inequalities we fitted an ecological regression model that included the socio economic indicator the period of time and the interaction between these terms . In men socio economic inequalities in all cancer and lung cancer mortality were observed in most of the cities studied but did not increase after the onset of the economic crisis . In women only two cities showed socio economic inequalities in all cancer and lung cancer mortality there was also no increase in inequalities . Our results did not validate our hypothesis that inequalities increase in times of crisis . However they emphasize the importance of socio economic measurements for understanding mortality inequalities and can be used to inform prevention strategies and help plan local health programs aimed at reducing health inequalities .",

The present work aims to estimate the incidence and prevalence of mCRPC in 2014 using the French nationwide healthcare database . Prevalence and incidence were estimated based on an SNDS extraction of men covered by the general healthcare insurance and aged 40 . Patients with mCRPC were identified amongst prostate cancer cases using an algorithm estimating a date of first metastasis management and a date of castration resistance . This algorithm was validated by clinical experts through a blind review of 200 anonymized medical charts from SNDS data . Prevalence and incidence were standardized on the European Standard Population . Prevalence and incidence of mCRPC were estimated as respectively 62 and 21 cases per 100 000 men in 2014 . Less than one mCRPC case per 100 000 was observed in men aged 4049 . Maximum mCRPC incidence was in men aged 8089 . The algorithm used for mCRPC identification had 97 positive and 99 negative predictive values . The good performances of the algorithm for mCRPC identification and the consistency of the generated results with the existing data highlight the robustness of these first estimates of mCRPC prevalence and incidence .

To improve uptake an intervention saw FIT kits sent directly to previously screened clients rather than by the usual invitation process comprising a letter of invitation followed by a FIT kit if requested . The intervention proved successful and was fully implemented into the programme for subsequent clients . Despite the improved uptake it was noted over time that the unsatisfactory FIT rate was approaching the programme standard . The aim of this study is to compare uptake by two invite methods occurring contemporaneously alongside advertising and to compare unsatisfactory rates before and after full FIT Direct implementation . Percentage uptake and 95 confidence intervals were calculated for each invite method before and after advertising and compared using two proportion z tests . Rate ratios and 95 CI compared the unsatisfactory FIT rate before and after full FIT Direct implementation . Uptake was significantly higher amongst FIT Direct compared with Usual Invite clients during and outside advertising . The unsatisfactory FIT rate was 2.3 times higher after full FIT Direct implementation compared with before . The FIT Direct intervention had an overall positive effect on uptake .

During the last decade the interest in the oleogel technology has dramatically increased due to the concern of the negative health effects of trans and saturated fats used in foods . Oleogels have been recognized as very promising alternatives to trans and saturated fats although none of them are yet used on a commercial basis . This is because oleogel technology is relatively new to the food industry . Fundamental studies have been conducted to understand gelation phenomena crystal structures of oleogelators and networks of crystals that affect physical properties of oleogels . Recently studies on their practical application in foods have also been conducted . Oleogels were incorporated in real foods such as cakes muffins biscuits sausages burgers instant fried noodles peanut butters and many other food products . Furthermore efforts have been made to enhance the gelation ability of an oleogelator by adding another oleogelator or an additive . It has been recognized that sensory properties and oxidative stability of oleogel containing foods are critical to the practical application of the oleogel technology in foods . These properties have been evaluated for spreads margarine cookies sausages meat patties and meat batters . Although some studies found that oleogels had positive or negligible negative effects on sensory and oxidation properties some studies found that further studies were needed to achieve satisfactory sensory properties and oxidative stability of oleogel containing food products .",

Therefore this extracellular signaling axis presents itself as a tantalizing target for promoting a favorable niche for the pathogen takeover of the host particularly for chronic infections . From the incorporation of virus encoded molecules such as micro RNAs and proteins enzymes to the envelopment of entire infectious particles evolutionary distinct viruses have shown a remarkable ability to converge on this means of communication . In this review we will cover the recent advances in this field and explore how EV can be used as potential biomarkers for chronic persistent or latent virus infections .",
        "Highlights":"Distinct viruses converged to usurp extracellular vesicle signaling. Extracellular vesicles transfer virus encoded factors during latency. Extracellular vesicles can be used for biomarker detection."

In particular self amplifying RNA derived from alphavirus expression vectors has shown to be very efficient to induce humoral and cellular responses against many antigens in preclinical models being superior to non replicating mRNA and DNA . This is mainly due to the fact that saRNA can provide very high expression levels and simultaneously induces strong innate responses potentiating immunity . saRNA can be administered as viral particles or DNA but direct delivery as RNA represents a safer and more simple approach . Although saRNA can be delivered as naked RNA",

The tails of bacteriophages recognize host cells and mediate host cell wall and membrane penetration . Recent cryo electron microscopy studies have revealed near atomic resolutions structures of the entire or almost entire bacteriophage particles of model systems including phi29 P22 P68 and T4 . These structures allow comparisons between not only different states of the same phage but also between distantly related phages . In this review we summarize the findings from recent structural studies of the bacteriophages that target Gram positive bacteria for a better understanding of the interactions between host cells and bacteriophages .",

While CYD TDV does not include non structural proteins of dengue TAK 003 contains the dengue virus serotype 2 backbone and the Butantan Merck vaccine contains three full genomes of the four dengue virus serotypes . While dengue primed individuals can already benefit from vaccination against all four serotypes with the first licensed dengue vaccine CYD TDV the need for dengue naive population has not yet been met .

The trade values can generally reflect periodical flows of cargo types and values between two economies while the geographical and transportation details can not be embodied although they are important for national logistics and supply chains . We investigate the vessel flows between two national maritime networks activated by possible implications to trade and shipping investments . The maritime network of flows between China and Vietnam is figured as a typical example under the consideration that the two countries are both typical maritime countries and the development of China is slowing down while Vietnam s economy and trade are booming . Using five years mutual connectivity data between Vietnam and China the flow directions and amounts are estimated and examined by network and flow analyzing methods . Maritime convection is introduced to investigate the changing cargo flows that represents supply chains between the two countries . Maritime fluctuation is used to study the strength and tendencies of seaborne trade between the two countries . These two aspects are visualized and conceptualized in the context of China s Belt and Road Initiative . New maritime interconnection facilities and opportunities are then discussed based on the results from this analysis . All methods for developing the networks and metrics of convection and fluctuation are incorporated into a system framework .

Increasing costs of construction and operation have rendered THSR tickets much more expensive than other forms of transportation . The effects of ticket price benefits on the relevant transportation agency and the distribution of passenger flow have been analyzed to improve the profitability of the THSR . However relying on analysis of passenger flow information alone may be insufficient to the adjustment of ticket fares . An evolutionary optimization model for maximizing the profits of the transportation agency that considers conflicts between executive decision making and passenger flow was developed herein . To resolve these conflicts the bi level planning approach was applied to consider both upper level and lower level planning and reflect passenger behavior and transportation profit management . Therefore developing business plans and strategies that maximize cost efficiency while optimally balancing passenger satisfaction and profitability could improve THSR performance . Results indicated that optimal fare rates should be divided into three groups 3.1 3.0 and 4.2 NTD person km for long medium and short distances respectively . This tool could be used to model and validate THSR fare adjustments and as a reference for authorities when making policy recommendations .",

Drivers riders the platform policymakers and the general public are considered as the main stakeholders of the system . While ride sourcing platforms have been growing so did the heightened tension between them and their drivers . That is why understanding drivers behaviour and preferences is of key importance to ride sourcing companies in managing their relationship with drivers and in retaining them in the presence of competence . Ride sourcing drivers are not only chauffeurs but fleet owners . They can make various operational and tactical decisions that directly influence other stakeholders and the transport system performance as a whole . Conducting a series of focus groups with ride sourcing drivers in the Netherlands we have studied their opinions about the system functionalities as well as their possible interactions with the platform and wishes for changes . The focus group results suggest that the main decisions of drivers which are ride acceptance relocation strategies working shift and area in which to work could be affected by many elements depending on platform strategies drivers characteristics riders attributes and exogenous factors . We find that part time and full time drivers as well as experienced and beginning drivers are characterized by distinctive behaviour .

Since traveler experiences in air journeys are a chain of services related to departure airport service airline service and arrival airport service a new index for measuring passenger satisfaction for air journeys is required . In a sense then this study is the first step towards integrating satisfaction literature to propose a robust index for air journeys . The Structural Equation Model was used to validate the theoretical model . The RCSI model was tested in the context of Colombian major domestic air route where traveler s perceived quality and perceived value were found to predict significantly overall passenger satisfaction . In this study we found that the RCSI score is similar to the average for the airline industry in ACSI . The findings show that the RCSI is less sensitive to outlier data than customer satisfaction indexes based on the ACSI model formulation . The RCSI model also allows the airline and airport managers to understand the specific factors which significantly influence overall traveler satisfaction by reading the causal relationship in the RCSI model .",

The impact mechanism is twofold . Firstly transport development can affect institutions including IPRs protection which in turn has an influence on innovation . Secondly evidence from existing economic literature suggests a link between transport development and innovation through economic agglomeration production factors and industrial flows . We first employ ordinary least squares regression to test the basic associations between transport development and innovation . We then apply two stage least squares regression analysis to address endogeneity and add a spatial model to examine neighbour effects . The findings show that IPRs protection has a positive effect on patenting and research and development while the roles played by transport development stock and density in patenting and R D are more mixed .

Although there are many methods that address the problems in pattern recognition algorithms effective solutions still need to be researched and explored . Hence this paper aims to address three of the issues surrounding these algorithms . First we propose adapting a promising meta heuristic called biased random key genetic algorithm which considers a random initial population construction . We call this algorithm as unsupervised feature selection by biased random key genetic algorithm I . Next we propose an approach for building the initial population partly in a deterministic way . Thus we applied this idea in two algorithms named unsupervised feature selection by particle swarm optimization and unsupervised feature selection by biased random key genetic algorithm II . Finally we simulated different datasets to study the effects of relevant and irrelevant attributes and of noisy and missing data on the performance of the algorithms . After the Wilcoxon rank sum test we can state that the proposed algorithms outperform all other methods in different datasets . It was also observed that the construction of the initial population in a partially deterministic way contributed to the better performance .

These cones are systematically contracted during the evolutionary search because an incremental specification of the DM s pairwise comparisons is progressively reducing the DM s most preferred region in the objective space . An inclusion of evolved solutions in this region is used along with the dominance relation to revise an elitism principle of the employed optimization algorithm . In this way the evolutionary search is focused on a subset of Pareto optimal solutions that are particularly interesting to the DM .

The results of the investigation demonstrate that the methods employed endow the airborne agents with the needed capability to ensure network survivability for complex ground activity including resilience to changes in the ground movement pattern and good responsiveness to activities that have no pattern at all such as uniform random walks .",

        "Abstract":"Recent years the multi objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition has been researched and applied for numerous optimization problems . In this study we propose an improved version of MOEA D with problem specific heuristics named PH MOEAD to solve the hybrid flowshop scheduling lot streaming problems where the variable sub lots constraint is considered to minimize four objectives i.e . the penalty caused by the average sojourn time the energy consumption in the last stage as well as the earliness and the tardiness values . For solving this complex scheduling problem each solution is coded by a two vector based solution representation i.e . a sub lot vector and a scheduling vector . Then a novel mutation heuristic considering the permutations in the sub lots is proposed which can improve the exploitation abilities . Next a problem specific crossover heuristic is developed which considered solutions with different sub lot size and therefore can make a solution feasible and enhance the exploration abilities of the algorithm as well . Moreover several problem specific lemmas are proposed and a right shift heuristic based on them is subsequently developed which can further improve the performance of the algorithm . Lastly a population initialization mechanism is embedded that can assign a fit reference vector for each solution . Through comprehensive computational comparisons and statistical analysis the highly effective performance of the proposed algorithm is favorably compared against several presented algorithms both in solution quality and population diversity .",

Feature selection is an important technique which selects small and informative feature subsets to improve the learning performance . Feature selection is not an easy task due to its large and complex search space . Recently swarm intelligence techniques have gained much attention from the feature selection community because of their simplicity and potential global search ability . However there has been no comprehensive surveys on swarm intelligence for feature selection in classification which is the most widely investigated area in feature selection . Only a few short surveys is this area are still lack of in depth discussions on the state of the art methods and the strengths and limitations of existing methods particularly in terms of the representation and search mechanisms which are two key components in adapting swarm intelligence to address feature selection problems . This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the state of the art works applying swarm intelligence to achieve feature selection in classification with a focus on the representation and search mechanisms . The expectation is to present an overview of different kinds of state of the art approaches together with their advantages and disadvantages encourage researchers to investigate more advanced methods provide practitioners guidances for choosing the appropriate methods to be used in real world scenarios and discuss potential limitations and issues for future research .",

However since there is not a gold standard for determining the screw positions for current MDO operations deviation of distraction direction and malocclusion increases . This case results in need of additional operations that affect the callus stability . In these cases relapse risk increases and remodelling period gets longer . On the other hand large volume of the distractor plates results in more invasive treatment and negatively affects the patients comfort . To overcome these problems this study offers a new method including virtual surgery simulation determining the optimum screw configuration using particle swarm optimization loop linked between MATLAB PYTHON ANSYS programs and the design of distractor plate geometry with topology optimization . In order to test the proposed method two different Finite Element models CM and OM were established based on conventional and optimum method respectively . FEA results of the current study reveals that OM has 33.56 less displacement compared to CM and the most critical screw in terms of screw loosening for OM has 35.29 less strain value than CM . These outcomes show OM shows superior callus stability in comparison with CM . On the other hand redesign of the distractor plates using topology optimization according to the best screw positions provides 43.32 reduction in the total implant volume which means reduced cost and a less invasive MDO operation . Therefore the clinical use of this protocol is expected to increase the success of the operation by shortening the recovery period .",

In the last decade machine learning techniques and plant images classification tools such as deep learning can be used for recognizing detecting and diagnosing plant diseases . Currently deep learning technology has been used for plant disease detection and classification . In this paper an ensemble model of two pre trained convolutional neural networks namely VGG16 and VGG19 have been developed for the task plant disease diagnosis by classifying the leaves images of healthy and unhealthy . In this context CNNs are used due to its capability of overcoming the technical problems which are associated with the classification problem of plant diseases . However CNNs suffer from a great variety of hyperparameters with specific architectures which is considered as a challenge to identify manually the optimal hyperparameters . Therefore orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized in this paper to optimize a number of these hyperparameters by finding optimal values for these hyperparameters rather than using traditional methods such as the manual trial and error method . In this paper to prevent CNNs from falling into the local minimum and to train efficiently an exponentially decaying learning rate schema is used . In this paper the problem of the imbalanced used dataset has been solved by using random minority oversampling and random majority undersampling methods and some restrictions in terms of both the number and diversity of samples have been overcome . The obtained results of this work show that the accuracy of the proposed model is very competitive .

However studies regarding energy consumption and environmental effects have rather been limited . This paper addresses the trade off between makespan and total energy consumption in hybrid flowshops where machines can operate at varying speed levels . A bi objective mixed integer linear programming model and a bi objective constraint programming model are proposed for the problem employing speed scaling . Since the objectives of minimizing makespan and total energy consumption are conflicting with each other the augmented epsilon constraint approach is used for obtaining the Pareto optimal solutions . While close approximations for the Pareto optimal frontier are obtained for small sized instances sets of non dominated solutions are obtained for large instances by solving the MILP and CP models under a time limit . As the problem is NP hard two variants of the iterated greedy algorithm a variable block insertion heuristic and four variants of ensemble of metaheuristic algorithms are also proposed as well as a novel constructive heuristic . The performances of the proposed seven bi objective metaheuristics are compared with each other as well as the MILP and CP solutions on a set of well known HFSP benchmarks in terms of cardinality closeness and diversity of the solutions . Initially the performances of the algorithms are tested on small sized instances with respect to the Pareto optimal solutions .

These stories provide information about exciting moments and memorable events which are usually emotional highpoints that can be useful for tourism marketers . Based on the sociological concept of storytelling this study investigates which aspects of the slow adventure experience travelers present in their travel blogs through a rubric elaborated on extant literature . The findings reveal three types of slow adventure stories and each type of story relates to a different identity construction . The article concludes with a discussion of its theoretical contributions in terms of adding to the literature of adventure tourism and storytelling . In revealing the themes and identities relating to specific slow adventure experiences it provides potential practical implications of travel blogs for slow adventure product designers and marketers .",

The results showed considerable participation of international PhD students in VFR tourism during their studies although at relatively low travel frequency . Students undertook a wide range of activities when travelling to visit their friends and relatives and often stayed with the visited friends or relatives . The findings also indicate a number of travel behavioural differences and similarities between the VF and VR categories . The study recognises potential growth of non traditional forms of VFR tourism such as VFR tourism in a third place and VFR in transit . A conceptual framework was proposed to help describe spatial flows of VFR tourism . Overall this paper adds to the understanding of the VFR tourism phenomenon in the global mobile context .",

Although this ecolabel is based primarily on environmental education and management it is argued that its core strength is the capacity to trigger political will . This paper presents the BF implementation process in a country through application of a BF Readiness Matrix and interviews with key stakeholders in eight coastal municipalities in Colombia . The matrix used 87 items to assess the level of compliance of 12 beaches with each of the 33 BF criteria . The challenges faced in the implementation of BF are presented and discussed . Because they are not unique to Colombia the results and conclusions are applicable to many low and middle income countries that historically have not committed to the management of tourist beaches . The conclusions underline the capacity of BF to raise political will to support beach management and generate specific management actions .",

Drawing on the results of visitor surveys in Kaikura New Zealand we analyse visitors experiences and their consideration of natural hazard risk and response abilities in relation to a damaging earthquake in the region in 2016 . Despite widespread national media and significant disruption findings suggest the disaster had very little impact on visitors perceptions and experiences and did not translate into greater preparedness . Instead tourists reported only limited knowledge about what to do or where to go in the event of a natural hazard event . Results suggest tourists resilience and Kaikura s resilience as a whole would be enhanced by improving knowledge sharing and awareness building . Furthermore by considering tourists as part of a linked social ecological system targeted interventions to improve understanding of natural hazards can support long term recovery trajectories and minimize future losses .",

        "Abstract":"The U.S. tourism and hospitality workforce is disproportionately represented by immigrants and minorities particularly in low wage jobs with adverse work conditions . Immigrant hotel and foodservice workers face excess chronic stress and related syndemic risks exacerbated by social political and economic inequities . COVID 19 has suddenly intensified the stressful and already difficult circumstances of immigrant service sector workers . The travel and tourism sector is one of the hardest hit due to widespread travel restrictions and shelter in place orders designed to curb infection spread . Restrictions and lockdowns have devastated tourism dependent destinations and displaced millions of vulnerable workers causing them to lose their livelihoods . Compared to the general workforce a sizeable increase in occupational stress has already been observed in the hospitality tourism sector over the past 1520years . COVID 19 and related fears add further strains on immigrant hotel and foodservice workers potentially exerting a significant toll on mental and physical health and safety .",

We compare hotel rents across tourist and non tourist destinations for an emerging and a developed market . Utilizing multiple regression on a combined dataset of 21 904 data points spread over 2458 unique hotels we show that the nature of destination and market moderates the association between hotel attributes and rents . Further the results show that hotels at tourist destinations enjoy a rent premium across markets . However this rent premium is positively associated with star rating only in emerging markets and is stable in developed markets . We contribute to price hedonic theory by proposing destination and market variables as moderators . Globalization and industry concentration make location decisions recurring and flexible . The study aims to help hotel managers by providing a contextual framework for making these strategic investment decisions .",

One of the more common initiatives involves the beautification of residential neighbourhoods through mural art . Seoul s Ihwa Mural Village is one of the most representative examples of the murals based regeneration trend . The residential area s transformation by artists in 2006 has made it one of the most popular murals tourism destinations albeit to the displeasure of a segment of the local population . In 2016 two of Ihwa Village s most iconic murals were destroyed by several residents . This paper explores the context behind the incident through in depth interviews with key stakeholders . Our research reveals that the Ihwa mural incident was not simply a local reaction to overtourism but also a response to the perceived unequal economic benefits accruing from the murals tourism . We offer recommendations for policy makers considering similar revitalization projects in residential neighbourhoods .",

        "Abstract":"Although postcolonial analyses examining the sexualized imagery of women in tourism have been conducted previous studies have predominantly focused on gender and colonialism from a patriarchal perspective . By doing so other colonial power asymmetries such as race class and ethnicity have often been neglected . This paper mobilises postcolonial feminist theory to expand the existing analyses and discourses concerning gendered representations in tourism . Through a narrative analysis of the images published in the official Instagram page of Sri Lanka s Ministry of Tourism we contend that the images produced and circulated to promote Sri Lanka in many instances echo essentialist gendered binaries . However as the images tend to produce and reiterate Sri Lankan national identity through a hegemonic Sinhalese Buddhist discourse they also show the intersections between gender and other asymmetries of power in reproducing colonial gendered identities .",

        "Abstract":"Markov model simulation based on the natural history of disease is commonly employed for the comparative research of health interventions . The present study aims to simulate the natural progression of breast cancer and parameterize the initial and transition probabilities of multiple states of breast cancer development among Chinese women . The age specific incidence mortality and clinical stage distribution of breast cancer and relapse rate of each clinical stage were collected from China s cancer registry yearbooks and clinical epidemiological studies to simulate the process from full health to breast cancer to death among Chinese women aged 30 to 80 through a Markov cohort study . The validity analysis was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the model estimation . A Markov transition model with 7 states was constructed for Chinese women . The age specific incidence mortality and clinical stage distribution of breast cancer estimated by the initial and transition probabilities among different Markov states were highly consistent with the registered data and observed studies . A breast cancer transition model for Chinese women has been established with validity . It could be a point of reference for further economic evaluations and breast cancer screening policy formulation .",
        "Highlights":"Key findings. A Markov transition model with 7 states no breast cancer tumor size number of nodes and metastasis stage 0 IV breast cancer and death was constructed for Chinese women. The initial and transition probabilities among different Markov states produced reliable predictions of age specific incidence mortality and clinical stage distribution of breast cancer which were highly consistent with the registered data and observed studies. What this adds to what is known. The MISCAN model which is most commonly adopted for economic evaluations of breast cancer screening incorporates the natural history of breast cancer based on white women. Owing to the important differences in epidemiological and clinicopathologic characteristics of breast cancer between white and Chinese women a state transition Markov model based on the natural history of breast cancer that is appropriate for Chinese women and consistent with clinical practice in China is necessary. What is the implication what should change now. A breast cancer transition model with Chinese population based natural history of breast cancer has been established with validity. This could be used as a reference for further economic evaluations and policy formulations of breast cancer mass screening. The economic evaluations of breast cancer screening programs in China can be further carried out with the present breast cancer transition model for the Chinese government to make decisions on the potential future expansion of the screening project and on financing mechanisms such as reimbursements into the national social insurance which is funded by government employers and citizens."

The unreasonable choice of screening methods and information processing can lead to the unjustified waste of resources with little benefit or even damage to the health of population and to the distortion of the statistic information . To evaluate the quality of medical examinations for chronic noncommunicable diseases among the adult population of the Irkutsk region from 2013 to2017 . We analyzed the Adult Clinical Examination report N 131 using comparative and statistical methods . It was selected for this study because it provides a summary of the findings from the Chronic Non Communicable Diseases surveys from 2013 to 2017 and thus precluded unnecessary investment of time and labor . The report comprises sections 1000 to 7000 which provided medical examination data such as demographic information and statistics on various diseases including neoplasms . The years 2016 and 2017 were notable for the emergence of 567 new cancers which accounted for 12.9 of total diagnoses . In 2017 there were 115 192 patients with cardiovascular diseases a fivefold increase from 2013 . Among the neurological dysfunctions 0.9 were ischemia attacks and related syndromes . The remaining 99.1 were not highlighted in the report . The respiratory system diseases were pneumonia bronchitis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease asthma asthmatic status and bronchiectasis . These diseases made up 68.3 of all pathologies of the respiratory system . The remaining 11 327 cases were not classified nosologically . Every section of the N 131 report showed significant inconsistencies among the summary survey results for both the Irkutsk Region and Russia . This could result in a misunderstanding of disease prevalence and consequently in improper decision making . At this point approaches to statistical analysis of health surveys must be reconsidered on a national scale .",
        "Highlights":"This article analyzes findings from the Chronic Non Communicable Diseases surveys generalized in the Adult Clinical Examination reports from 2013 to2017. Findings can be used as a framework for organizing a prevention mechanism against chronic noncommunicable diseases in Russia."

        "Abstract":"Quality adjusted life year is widely applied nowadays which consider both survival and quality of life . When most diseases are becoming chronic it is imperative to quantify the overall health impact of a disease in lifetime perspective . The purpose of this study is to introduce methods for estimating quality adjusted life expectancy and loss of QALE in patients with a disease or specific conditions . The QALE of an index cohort can be represented as the integration of the product of lifetime survival function and mean QoL function . We introduce a robust extrapolation approach for estimating lifetime survival function and propose an approach for estimating lifetime mean QoL function for studies with limited follow up . The best part of the proposed method is that the survival data and QoL data can be collected separately . A cohort of patients with a specific condition can be identified by databases that regularly collect data for the control of diseases and their survival status is verified by linking to a mortality registry . Although nationwide QoL data are not available researchers can implement a relative short term follow up interview on a random sample of patients to collect QoL data . For demonstration we applied the proposed methods to estimate QALE and loss of QALE of oral cancer patients . The estimates of QALE for oral cancer patients were 11.0 and 14.2 quality adjusted life years for men and women respectively . The estimates of loss of QALE for the male and female patients with oral cancer were 14.4 and 7.5 QALYs respectively . The methods for estimating QALE and loss of QALE can be applied to economic evaluation of cancer control including screening .",

This project uses publically available activity data from the Medicare Benefits Scheme to quantify the uptake of videoconference for psychology resulting from the initiative change . Data were extracted from the Medicare Benefits Schedule item reports using the item codes for standard consultations and the new item codes for videoconference consultations . Activity data from 2 years before and the first year of the change to the Better Access initiative were compared to examine the uptake of videoconference for psychology . Data were stratified by allied health profession sex age and state jurisdiction . In the 1 year period after the introduction of reimbursed videoconference consultations approximately 5.7 million in person consultations and 4141 videoconference consultations were funded by Medicare in Australia . Videoconference consultations comprised 0.07 of the total consultations performed in that 1 year period and showed an increased trajectory . The results can guide future research into evaluating the clinical outcomes of patients via both in person and videoconference delivery modes . Videoconference mental health services were used in the first year that they were available although they only accounted for a small percentage of all mental health consultations provided by allied health professionals .

Meanwhile many new drugs are introduced each year as a result of technological advances . This study uses diabetes as an example to investigate the relative importance of population aging and technological innovation in accounting for the growth of health expenditures . The retrospective cohort study was conducted based on claims data covering 1997 to 2006 taken from Taiwans National Health Insurance . Patients were selected based on whether they received antidiabetic drugs . Growth in health expenditure was decomposed into 3 parts number of patients mean treatment cost and the interaction between the change in the mean treatment cost and the change in the number of patients . The results indicated that 75 of the growth in expenditures for treating diabetic patients is attributable to the effect of population aging as reflected by the increase in the diabetes prevalence rate and disease severity . Technological innovation in the form of treatment substitution and treatment expansion effects accounted for only about 25 of the growth in expenditures for treating diabetic patients . Population aging plays a more significant role than technological innovation in driving up health expenditures for the treatment of diabetic patients . This suggests that population aging may contribute significantly to the future growth of the healthcare sector in Asian countries such as Taiwan .",

Rasch analysis indicated variance explained values of 88.3 and the eigenvalues of the first contrast was 1.3 further confirming the unidimensionality of the scale whose fit index values were within accepted ranges . The high item and person separation and reliability values indicated the instruments strength in detecting and evenly spreading items and persons on the Wright map based on item difficulty and the respondents ability levels respectively . The EQ 5D 5L scale performed well in uncomplicated malaria hence it is recommended for use in the assessment of health related quality of life in this patient population .",
        "Highlights":"Malaria is an endemic disease throughout Nigeria which is a developing country with high poverty levels of citizens. Inappropriate management of the disease has been reported with material resources health workers and patient related factors implicated as reasons for such practices with reported health and financial consequences on both the patients and the systems. This study confirmed the reliability and validity of an English version of the 5 level EuroQol 5 dimensional questionnaire scale for assessing health related quality of life impacts of malaria among patients who received treatment in primary healthcare settings in Plateau state Nigeria which was the first of its kind in Nigeria based on literature review. In addition the study showed the usefulness of the scale for conducting children of 12 years old and adult patients health related quality of life studies which would be useful for advising patients healthcare professionals and health policymakers in necessary attentions and interventions aimed at improving patients quality of malaria management toward achieving the desired therapeutic outcomes for better quality of life."

        "Abstract":"Most countries recommend that their healthcare personnel be vaccinated against influenza in order to protect themselves as well as their patients . However despite the strong scientific rationale recommendations and advocacy from health organizations influenza vaccination coverage among healthcare personnel remains low . This has been attributed to various obstacles and a range of strategies have been implemented to increase uptake with varying levels of success . To highlight the vaccination coverage beliefs and obstacles among healthcare personnel in India and to discuss strategies that can be implemented to improve influenza vaccination coverage . Various barriers are responsible for the low influenza vaccination coverage among Indian healthcare personnel . Many interventions are being practiced but they need to be multidimensional keeping in mind that healthcare personnel value their autonomy in making decisions about vaccinations .",
        "Highlights":"In 2018 ie the centenary year of the influenza pandemic the world including India was burdened with significant mortality and morbidity due to influenza. Evidence suggests healthcare personnel are a high risk population. Despite an array of attempted strategies vaccination coverage among healthcare personnel has been observed to be low. To improve this situation several policies can be implemented such as generating awareness to increase vaccination acceptance rates vaccinating healthcare personnel on a priority basis training them periodically and increasing availability and access to vaccines."

The objective of this study was to compare the prices of some selected drugs in SAARC countries . A list of 24 drugs was prepared based on certain inclusion and exclusion criteria . The retail prices of the drugs were determined from different sources and verified manually in the open market . The prices obtained in local currencies were converted into US dollars for comparison purposes . In another analysis the gross domestic product of each country was factored for comparative analysis . Out of the 23 drugs 17 comparisons across countries were statistically different at Prices of selected drugs varied markedly in SAARC countries . After adjusting for GDP drug prices became more polarized across countries with Nepal featuring the highest prices . In determining drug prices the countrys GDP and the populations purchasing power need to be taken into account .",
        "Highlights":"The SAARC South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation is a geopolitical organization composed of 8 countries Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan India the Maldives Nepal Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Almost a quarter of the world population lives in these 8 countries. To date no study has looked at a comparative analysis of drug prices in the SAARC region. Therefore this study was conducted with the aim of comparing the prices of selected drugs in SAARC countries. The prices of selected drugs vary markedly in SAARC countries. At face value Sri Lanka was found to have the highest prices of selected drugs but the same drugs were sold at higher prices in Nepal after adjusting the median prices with the gross domestic product. When fixing the prices of drugs the gross domestic product and purchasing power of the population needs to be taken into account."

This analysis evaluated the cost effectiveness of the ombitasvir paritaprevir ritonavir and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin regimen as compared with the PegIFN RBV or no treatment in chronic HCV Genotype 1 treatment nave and treatment experienced cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients in Malaysia . A Markov model based on previously published CE models of HCV was adapted for the Malaysian public healthcare payer perspective based on good modeling practices . Treatment attributes included efficacy regimen duration and EQ 5D treatment related health utility . Transitional probabilities and health state health utilities were derived from previous studies . Costs were derived from Malaysian data sources . Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.0 per year . Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainties around key variables . Based on the analysis patients treated with the OBT PTV r DSBRBV showed less frequent progression to compensated cirrhosis decompensated cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma and liver related deaths when compared with standard care . At a price of MYR 1846 day the OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen is cost effective over PegIFN RBV and yields better outcomes in terms of life years gained and quality adjusted life years at a higher cost which is still well below the implied willingness to pay threshold of MYR 384 503 QALY . The OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen is cost effective for treatment nave treatment experienced cirrhotic and noncirrhotic GT1 chronic HCV patients in Malaysia .",
        "Highlights":"In Malaysia only the combination of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin PegIFN RBV is reimbursed by the Malaysian authorities as the gold standard in treating chronic hepatitis C virus HCV patients. Although the favorable cost effectiveness CE profile of the ombitasvir paritaprevir ritonavir and dasabuvir with or without ribavarin OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen compared with multiple standards of care has been documented worldwide evidence from Malaysia is limited. This analysis evaluated the CE of the OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen compared with PegIFN RBV or no treatment for chronic HCV genotype 1 for treatment nave and treatment experienced cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients in Malaysia. This CE analysis reveals that the OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen provides superior clinical outcomes versus the current standard of care in Malaysia ie PegIFN RBV and no treatment with fewer patients treated with the OBT PTV r DSBRBV regimen experiencing HCV related complications of CC DCC HCC and liver related deaths. In turn patients treated with the OBT PTV r DSB RBV regimen have a favorable CE profile with higher numbers of life years Lys gained and quality adjusted life years QALYs than patients treated with standard of care."

The focus of this research was on the entire healthcare system without considering any specific healthcare service or population group . This article explains the conditions of equity in peoples payments for healthcare services in LMICs and focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of successful or failed healthcare systems . A systematic search was conducted in the existing database that included the data up to December 2016 . The quantity of equity was estimated using relevant indicators and comparing the results with indicators specific values . Narrative synthesis was then performed for the purpose of reporting the results . A total of 17 articles from 14 regions including Palestine China China China Ghana Hungary Iran Tunisia Tanzania Malaysia Malawi Zimbabwe Uganda and Chile met the inclusion criteria . The findings indicated that the insurance system is the most equitable method of financing whereas direct payment is the most unfair method . Nevertheless many countries still struggle with various payment methods and people use direct payments . Results revealed that several factors can affect a countrys failure to establish equity in financing the health system . These factors include an increase in direct payments by people to reduce the governments share failure to cover insurance for the entire population and problems in identifying people from low income groups and setting rules for exempting them from taxes .",

This study aims to identify the length of stay and cost of care at ICUs which are proxy indicators of efficiency and the factors determining them . A cross sectional study of patients requiring ICU admissions in a teaching hospital in Malaysia from 2013 to 2015 was conducted . The cost at the ICU was estimated using the step down approach . Factors that determined the cost and LOS at the ICU were also explored by using multivariate regression analysis . Each day of stay cost 427 at the pediatric intensive care unit and 1324 at the general intensive care unit . The mean LOS at the ICU was 5.7 days 8.4 with a median of 4 days 1 16.7 days . Average cost of care at the ICU per episode of care was 5473 and the median was 3463 . ICU patients spent 29.3 of the total stay and 47.2 of the cost at ICU units . Upon multivariate regression analysis severity case base group and type of ICU that the patient was admitted to were associated with the cost and LOS at ICU . Compared with critical care practices in hospitals from more developed nations a Malaysian teaching hospital required a longer length of ICU stay . Hence implementations of strategies that can reduce the length of stay and hospital costs without compromising healthcare quality are required .",
        "Highlights":"No detailed information is yet available on the cost of care at intensive care units ICUs in Malaysia and its determinants. This article describes length of stay and cost of care at the ICU and the factors influencing them. Our study findings aim to support health managers and policy makers to explore strategies that can reduce the length of stay and hospital costs without affecting healthcare quality. Relatively younger ICU patients at the Malaysian institution and the cost differential by units implies the ICU policy needs to be reviewed as do disease intervention strategies for the younger age group."

This article summarizes the discussions held by the participants at the 40th ISPOR HTA Council Roundtable for LA . An additional literature review was carried out to support some of the concepts included . This article includes a brief description of the implementation of HTA over the last 30 years and then a conceptual analysis using examples of the broader use of HTA to support procurement decisions and risk sharing agreements which might play a future role in healthcare priority setting in LA . Formerly HTA processes and methods played important although mostly isolated roles . Nowadays with more and more innovative technologies and the establishment of value frameworks to support the priority setting in healthcare HTA features a promising panorama for the health systems sustainability .",
        "Highlights":"Several countries in Latin America have shown an interest in developing health technology assessments HTAs but the implementation has not been uniform and has faced challenges because of health system characteristics and the political or economic contexts. Moving systematic reviews and synthesis beyond clinical epidemiologic and economic research into qualitative and quantitative research in patient caregiver and citizen generated information such as perceptions valuation and outcomes is an immediate need in HTA in the region. In LA countries where HTA has been established it is reaching a mature state which offers a benchmark for countries where the process is still under development. HTA in LA has been widely applied to support the coverage and reimbursement decisions of emergent and established medical technologies. The development of innovative technologies and the establishment of value frameworks to support the priority setting in healthcare centralized purchase and risk sharing agreements suggests a promising panorama for the use of HTA in the context of the health systemssustainability."

        "Abstract":"Healthcare costs are a concern for the sustainability of health systems in both rich and poor countries . Achieving a balance between the aspirations of payers and the manufacturers of new technologies is a challenge for democratic societies . Evidence about the efficacy and effectiveness of a new intervention is a fundamental aspect for its inclusion but additional information about organization implementation and feasibility is required . Economic evaluations especially cost effectiveness analyses help inform the choice of a particular health intervention but they are not the only input for decision making . Use of CEA is relatively recent but has quickly become widespread . CEA techniques have evolved into increasingly complex and sophisticated methods intended to reflect reality closely but at the same time their results have become more difficult to verify and validate . In developed countries CEA results have generated intense debates but in developing countries these reflections are still weak due to lack of technical capacity . Competing perspectives on CEAs exist and can heavily influence the DM process . The use of CEAs and the interpretation of their results requires critical analysis especially when public funds are to be invested . Here we present a perspective on the use of CEAs for DM that arises from our experience of its use in developing countries and requires the consideration of other rationalities in addition to the economic one for DM .",
        "Highlights":"Decision making DM in public health should be based on objective criteria to make the best investments with scarce resources. The cost effectiveness analysis CEA has earned a reputation as one of the strongest ways to obtain evidence for informing DM. We discuss how DM is often based on CEA results especially when it comes to immunization planning but also how other rationalities outside of the economic sphere are necessary to overcome the CEAs limitations. A critical perspective when using CEA results is proposed to reach the maximum populations well being from a democratic perspective this involves considering other inputs in the discussion as well."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of natalizumab compared with fingolimod for treating highly active relapsing remitting MS patients from the Colombian third party payer perspective . We used a Markov economic model from the perspective of the Colombian healthcare system to estimate the cost effectiveness of natalizumab compared with fingolimod for RRMS with high disease activity or failure of interferons as first line therapy . This model was centered on disability progression and relapses . We considered a 5 year time horizon with a 5 discount rate . We included only direct medical costs . Local experts were consulted to obtain resource utilization estimates and local standardized costing methodologies and sources were used . Outcome was considered in terms of quality adjusted life years . Utilities were extracted or calculated from the literature . Transition probabilities were calculated from available efficacy and safety information . Natalizumab showed lower total costs and higher QALY yield than fingolimod dominating it . Univariate sensitivity analysis showcased the relevance of the measures of effect on disability progression for natalizumab on model results . Probabilistic sensitivity analysis replicated base case results in most simulations . This study showed that natalizumab dominated fingolimod with lower costs and higher QALYs in patients with high activity RRMS . These results are consistent with previous published international literature .",

        "Abstract":"Countries have constrained healthcare budgets and must prioritize new interventions depending on health goals and time frame . This situation is relevant in the sphere of national immunization programs for which many different vaccines are proposed budgets are limited and efficient choices must be made in the order of vaccine introduction . A constrained optimization model for infectious diseases was developed in which different intervention types were combined for consideration in Malaysia . Local experts defined their priority public health issues pneumococcal disease dengue hepatitis B and C rotavirus neonatal pertussis and cholera . Epidemiological cost and effectiveness data were informed from local or regionally published literature . The model aimed to maximize quality adjusted life year gain through the reduction of events in each of the different diseases under budget and intervention coverage constraints . The QALY impact of the interventions was assessed over 2 periods lifetime and 20 years . The period of investment was limited to 15 years . The assessment time horizon influenced the prioritization of interventions maximizing QALY gain . The incremental health gains compared with a uninformed prioritization were large for the first 8 years and declined thereafter . Rotaviral and pneumococcal vaccines were identified as key priorities irrespective of time horizon hepatitis B immune prophylaxis and hepatitis C treatment were priorities with the lifetime horizon and dengue vaccination replaced these with the 20 year horizon . CO modeling is a useful tool for making economically efficient decisions within public health programs for the control of infectious diseases by helping prioritize the selection of interventions to maximize health gain under annual budget constraints .",
        "Highlights":"There is an increasing unmet demand for health interventions at a country level while the associated budgets are restricted. Under such circumstances new interventions are to be prioritized to maximize societal health gain. Traditional health economic analyses have limitations when assessing multiple interventions across disease areas while considering budget limitations. Constrained optimization is a method that helps address these limitations. When applied to a Malaysian setting with a focus on interventions targeting infectious diseases and maximizing quality adjusted life year gain over lifetime or 20 years the optimized order of introduction of the interventions under annual budget constraints was dependent on the period of assessment. The constrained optimization method itself was found to be transparent and easy to apply and should be considered as a full value assessment of economic efficiency in the field of healthcare as it has been effectively used for many years in other sectors of industry such as fishery agriculture forestry and tourism among others."

A systematic literature review was conducted following the Cochrane Handbook and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis Protocols checklist . The quality of reviewed studies was examined using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards statement . A total of 15 articles on the economic evaluation of breast cancer early detection based in Asia were reviewed . Cost effectiveness was used in all the studies as the analytic method to compare the cost and consequences of different screening policies . Ten studies were categorized as incorporating the modeled approach . Fourteen studies analysed the cost effectiveness of the organized population based approach in which mammography screening was the prevailing screening modality . Only one study evaluated the cost effectiveness of early diagnosis for breast cancer patients in order to provide early treatment . The results from the identified economic evaluations and consequent recommendations concerning optimal early detection strategies varied among studies and depended on key parameters and assumption used as well as differences in inter country health resources breast cancer incidence prevalence and early detection pathways . The economic evaluation of breast cancer early detection programs is still limited in Asia . Policy decisions on organized mammography screening in women 50 are economically attractive in the region despite the lack of evidence to provide recommendations on opportunistic screening strategy and early diagnosis strategy . Future studies need to provide better transparency of the data used and cover more comprehensive strategies to make them relevant and adaptable to other Asian countries resulting in clear policy recommendations on breast cancer early detection strategies .",
        "Highlights":"Asia which faces both health and financial burdens as a result of breast cancer has been less explored than Europe and North America in the literature. This absence of region specific evidence poses a significant threat in that findings on safety effectiveness and cost effectiveness may differ substantially. Given the considerable uncertainty when generalizing results from developed Western nations to Asia it is essential to have region specific comparative evidence on the variability of the economic analysis of strategies to recognize breast cancer at an early stage. This review attempts to support the development of practical guidelines on breast cancer early detection strategy in Asia by evaluating such strategies in Asian countries and synthesizing the availability and variability of the health related economic evaluations made."

The first is a national cost database and website hosting cost data collected from 200 public sector facilities across 6 Indian states at each level of the care delivery system by a consortium of health research institutes . This database is the first of its kind in India and will serve as a central resource for researchers and decision makers for information on healthcare costs . The second is a nationwide costing study of healthcare at both private and public facilities . By improving the availability of cost data in India raising its profile and demonstrating its utility it is hoped that the database and new costing efforts will lead to greater recognition of the importance of good quality data to inform health policy and enable more evidence informed decision making .",
        "Highlights":"The Indian Governments ambitious Universal Healthcare Coverage scheme includes insurance coverage for the 500 million beneficiaries and strengthened primary healthcare services. The lack of systematically collected robust cost data limits the schemes capacity in price setting and health technology appraisal and a call to action is needed. A National Health System Cost database and a government sponsored nationwide costing survey are enabling better and more informed decision making in one of the largest Universal Health Coverage programs in the world."

        "Abstract":"This study aims to translate culturally adapt and validate the Short Form 6D instruments for measuring quality of life as outcome parameters in pharmacoeconomic studies . The forward backward methods were applied to translate the SF 6D questionnaire . A preliminary Indonesian version of SF 6D questionnaire was field tested in samples of 470 adult general population . Testretest reliability was assessed by using Spearman rank correlation coefficient and internal consistency with Cronbach . Face validity was assessed descriptively based on the response of the respondents to all items in SF 6D . The construct validity test included internal construct validity and convergent validity which was assessed by examining the correlation between the questionnaire and Euro Quality of life 5D based on the scale of each domain . The known group method was used to test discriminant validity . Mann Whitney The SF 6D was a valid and reliable questionnaire indicated by the reliability coefficient of 0.725 and the value of each item ranging from 0.698 to 0.750 . Construct validity indicated a strong correlation between physical functioning role limitation social functioning pain and mental health with the SF 6D utility score . Convergent validity showed a weak and moderate correlation between dimensions on SF 6D and Euro Quality of life 5D . The SF 6D questionnaire has been translated into Indonesian version . The SF 6D questionnaire is valid and reliable . Known group validity shows that the SF 6D could differentiate utility scores by age group and history present illness .",
        "Highlights":"Short Form 6D SF 6D questionnaire is a generic questionnaire to measure health related quality of life and has been widely used for surveys in populations clinical practices and clinical trials. SF 6D can also be used in economic evaluations for a preference based single index estimate of health status. The algorithm for SF 6D scoring has been developed by the University of Sheffield United Kingdom. The Indonesian version of SF 6D is not available yet. Therefore there is a need for translation cultural adaptation and validation of the SF 6D instrument to the Indonesian version as one of the instruments to measure utility. The results showed that SF 6D is a valid and reliable measurement tool for health related quality of life in the general Indonesian population. SF 6D also could differentiate utility scores by age group and history present illness. SF 6D can be used as a reference for preference based assessments research. This study provides an alternative instrument to express the value of healthcare including health utility assessments for decision making in determining cost effective intervention strategies."

        "Abstract":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of adopting a pharmaceutical care model on clinical outcomes patient satisfaction and cost at a health payer level . All patients with hepatitis C virus who were insured by Bupa Arabia with a direct acting antivirals prior authorization drug request between April 2015 and October 2018 were included in this retrospective quasi experimental study . The clinical outcome was the achievement of a sustained virologic response at least 12 weeks from end of treatment . Economic and patients satisfaction outcomes were included in this study . The differences in cost of treatment was analyzed by using the paired A total of 371 patients were enrolled in this program of which 74 required clinical intervention . Among those HCV treatment was modified for 64 . The overall cure rate was 97 among 267 patients for which sustained virologic responses were available . The results of the paired A structured pharmaceutical care program for HCV patients can guide the use of specialty medications to achieve optimal clinical outcomes with lower expenditures and high patients satisfaction . We can conclude that healthcare insurance can play a key role in managing specialty pharmaceuticals like HCV medications . Because this is a preliminary study further studies are needed in an experimental design to strengthen the evidence behind the effectiveness of such a program .",
        "Highlights":"This is the first ever health insurance level report in a developing country that assessed the economic cost and clinical value of the pharmaceutical care program for chronic patients. Researches describing the impact of the pharmaceutical care are limited to the hospital and community pharmacies. Yet this study is very important because it displays and builds the concept in view of different field which is the health insurance system. This study presents and displays that a new pharmaceutical care program for hepatitis C medications is necessary to achieve the best outcomes. In addition it bridges the gap and shows the relation between several pharmaceutical concepts pharmaceutical care model and pharmaceutical specialties with a new application at health insurance system. Moreover it advocates a new role of the clinical pharmacist at health payer that is not available nowadays at least in the Middle East. This study specifically designed to highlight the importance of the pharmaceutical care program and its impact on the cost and promote an understanding on the possibilities of implementing such model that could be affecting a part of our community and to provide ways of dealing with it. It does as well to support the policy makers in the coverage of certain type of medications by health insurance system."

        "Abstract":"To characterize at a global level the concept of therapeutic value and describe the experience of value based pricing policies in 6 reference countries . We conducted a rapid review of the literature that addressed 2 exploratory research questions . A systematic and exhaustive search was carried out up to July 2018 in MEDLINE Embase Scopus and Web of Science . The concepts of TV and VBP are related value frameworks for medicines should include social preferences comparative effectiveness safety adoption viability social impact high quality of evidence severity of illness and innovation . The added therapeutic value is the manner of measuring the therapeutic advantages of new medicines compared with existing ones in terms of comparative effectiveness and safety . There are variations in the mechanisms of reimbursement and drug pricing regulation between the countries of study . In a VBP system it is essential to establish the TV and ATV of a new medicine . Although there are no methodological guidelines for the implementation of VBP policies the process implies from the beginning the definition of TV categories that will be included in the drug pricing and reimbursement systems . Agreements between the pharmaceutical industry and governments have become a useful tool as a negotiating mechanism in most countries .",
        "Highlights":"In general within the identified literature there is no methodological guideline for the implementation of value based pricing policies. The system consists of individual exercises which require the development of categories of therapeutic value to be subsequently included in drug pricing and reimbursement systems. The concept of therapeutic value is related to the therapeutic properties of medications their clinical effectiveness and health outcomes. When these characteristics are compared with other therapeutic alternatives available in the market the definition is framed in the concept of added therapeutic value. It is important to consider the social value such as equity social justice patient autonomy quality of life of caregivers and the benefits achieved through better adherence by the patient to capture the value beyond clinical and economic effectiveness."

        "Abstract":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a severe progressive disease with poor prognosis . Patients show an increased healthcare utilization pattern consisting of regular physician consultations and monitoring tests . The aim of the present study was to estimate healthcare resource utilization and out of pocket expenditures for IPF patients in Greece . An IPF specific questionnaire was constructed which focused on retrospective healthcare resource utilization and out of pocket expenditures within a 6 month period . Upon informed consent the questionnaires were completed anonymously . The study sample included 123 IPF patients . Within a 6 month period 85.4 of the patients visited their treating physician 1.400 29.4 visited other physicians for IPF related reasons 42.9 visited a healthcare setting and 10.6 required hospitalization . Spirometry and blood tests were the most common tests for IPF monitoring . Almost half of the respondents stated they had private expenditures for IPF medication physician visits hospital services medical tests or other IPF related reasons . IPF management requires regular contact with healthcare services and uptake of specific medical tests . Considering the high proportion of patients bearing out of pocket costs along with the decline of incomes in Greece improvement of the disease management is important and action should be taken to lower the financial burden imposed on patients .",
        "Highlights":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF imposes a high economic burden on both patients and healthcare systems. Although the overall cost and healthcare utilization of IPF has been identified as quite high for health systems worldwide the cost that the disease imposes on individual patients has not been investigated. The participation of almost half of the IPF patients in this study to their health expenditure is alarming in light of the high cost that the disease incurs. Considering the decreased income and constantly decreasing pensions in Greece a reasonable question arises as for how long IPF patients along with other chronic patients will be able to bear the economic burden imposed by the disease and the inadequate support of the state."

        "Abstract":"To introduce and discuss the cost and effectiveness of using sofosbuvir daclatasvir and simeprevir antivirals in combination or not with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C as based on real world data . We analyzed the treatment and outcomes of 253 patients from a retrospective cohort held in a specialized assistance service in the municipality of Porto Alegre Brazil . Regarding costs we considered only the direct costs of the antiviral medications per unit according to the financial receipts of the public procurements . We calculated the total cost of treatment per individual and the cost per cure expressed in sustained virologic response . Most patients were carriers of the genotype 1 of hepatitis and 92.9 reached the SVR . The average cost of the treatment for genotype 1 patients was 5 862.31 USD per patient and 6 310.34 for the cure for genotype 3 patients on the other hand the cost was 5 144.27 per patient and 5 974.76 for the cure . The drugs purchasing cost was around 40 less than was estimated for the process of incorporating them into the public health system . The results indicated that good rates of effectiveness were achieved with different combinations of the medicines . The costs of the medicines were still deemed too high for the Brazilian reality however . Therefore the results contribute to support the formulation and review of public policies based on strong evidence and on real world data for the treatment of hepatitis C .",
        "Highlights":"Hepatitis C is considered a global public health issue. The emergence in recent years of treatment options with high levels of efficacy and safety but which also bear a high cost has emphasized the need to study the disease from an economic point of view. This work analyzes the incorporation to the public health system of sofosbuvir daclatasvir and simeprevir and is based on real world data. The results indicated that good rates of effectiveness were achieved with different combinations of the medicines for Hepatitis C treatment. The cost of purchasing the drugs was around 40 less than was estimated however the cost of the medicines is still too high for Brazil. Centralizing procurement and making negotiations within the industry are proving to be good strategies for reducing the paid amounts. The results show the primary data of effectiveness and cost in a real world scenario that may help future economic evaluations and we address the importance of negotiating the prices of medicines to guarantee access."

        "Abstract":"To elicit a willingness to pay per quality adjusted life year estimate for the general Greek population and assess the impact of individuals socio demographic characteristics and motives on this estimate . A telephone based survey was carried out employing a representative sample of the general Greek population . A computer assisted telephone interview method was adopted to ensure random sampling . A total of 528 participants reported a WTP value for a utility improvement from their current health to perfect health . Those individuals motives were assessed through predefined statements . Testretest reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient . Multiple linear regression and one way analysis of variance tests were conducted to assess the effect of socioeconomic demographic determinants and motive statements respectively on WTP QALY . MLR was re estimated considering as dependent variable the WTP QALY estimate calculated for participants stating a WTP value their household income and presenting higher certainty regarding stated WTP value . Analysis revealed good reliability for WTP QALY estimates and motive statements . Mean WTP QALY was 26280 . The respective 5 trimmed value was 14862 . Being a student and household income affected WTP QALY . Sensitivity analysis did not produce markedly different WTP QALY predictors implying the robustness of results irrespective of the participant group considered . Individuals who indicated the inability to cover basic family needs or pay tax claims as motives reported lower WTP QALY values compared with those not viewing these aspects as motives . Findings confirm that the World Health Organizations criterion used currently in Greek cost effectiveness studies is not unreasonable . Additional research is essential to further explore WTP QALY estimates in the Greek setting and facilitate informed decision making .",
        "Highlights":"In Greece willingness to pay WTP per quality adjusted life year QALY estimates have been determined only for discrete interventions related to specific diseases and patient populations. Therefore applied Greek economic evaluations adopt the World Health Organizations recommendation of 1 to 3 times the countrys gross domestic product per capita to assess interventions cost effectiveness. The monetary estimate for an additional QALY calculated for the general Greek population falls within the cost effectiveness threshold recommended by the World Health Organization. The currently elicited WTP per QALY value constitutes the first such estimate in the Greek setting that considers the general country population. Despite the need for additional research this estimate could be used henceforth to assist informed decision making in the Greek healthcare setting."

        "Abstract":"The analysis aims to assess the cost effectiveness of cefuroxime in the prophylaxis of postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract surgery compared with the absence of antibiotic prophylaxis from the National Health Fund perspective in Poland . We performed a cost effectiveness and cost utility analysis using the decision tree and Markov model respectively for patients after cataract surgery . The efficacy of Aprokam was 0.21 0.08 0.55 and is based on the results of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery study . According to the epidemiological data from Poland the risk of POE is 0.377 . The costs associated with the Aprokam administration and POE treatment costs were included . We determined the utilities of the health states in the model depending on visual loss due to POE . To determine the uncertainty of estimates parameters a one way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed . Using Aprokam allows avoiding 0.003 POEs per patient . The benefit from the intervention is 0.0007 quality adjusted life years per patient in the lifetime horizon . The total costs of prophylaxis are higher at about 1.70 . The cost of avoiding one POE is about 569.85 . The estimated incremental cost effectiveness utility ratio is equal to 2427.72 quality adjusted life years and it is significantly lower than the cost effectiveness threshold in Poland in 2019 . In all scenarios of performed one way sensitivity analyses Aprokam is cost effective . In Poland the use of Aprokam is cost effective with the estimated incremental cost utility ratio significantly lower than the cost effectiveness threshold .",
        "Highlights":"Endophthalmitis is one of the most serious complications after cataract surgery. The incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis POE in Europe ranges from 0.03 to 1.2 and depends on the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. Owing to the serious health consequences of POE and despite its relatively low incidence clinical guidelines recommend the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. In this study we assessed the cost effectiveness of cefuroxime Aprokam Laboratoires Thea France in the prophylaxis of POE after cataract surgery compared with the absence of antibiotic prophylaxis in the context of the Polish healthcare system. Intracameral administration of cefuroxime Aprokam after cataract surgery allows avoiding 0.003 POE events per patient with prophylaxis. In Poland the use of Aprokam is cost effective with the estimated incremental cost utility ratio significantly lower than the cost effectiveness threshold."

        "Abstract":"Severe consequences of mother to child transmission of syphilis and high increasing incidence of congenital syphilis remains an important public health problem in Brazil . Our objective was to assess the cost effectiveness of a rapid point of care test and treatment of positive mothers immediately compared with a laboratory based standard test with treatment at next follow up visit . A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness ratio between antenatal syphilis screening strategies . The model was built with lifetime horizon from Brazilian health system perspective using 3 and 5 discount rates . A hypothetical cohort of pregnant women at reproductive age were used in the model . Health outcomes low birth weight stillbirths neonatal deaths and congenital syphilis were estimated in disability adjusted life years lost . Microcosting study and secondary data provided parameters of direct medical costs . Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken . For base case the mean cost per pregnant woman screened was 2.63 and 2.48 respectively . Maternal syphilis was associated with a loss of 0.0043 DALYs and 0.0048 DALYs per mother screened . Expected value of incremental cost per DALY averted was 298.08 . After 10000 probabilistic sensitivity analysis model runs incremental cost and health benefits were 0.15 and 0.00042 DALYs respectively with a mean ICER of 357.44 per DALY . Screening with RT has a 58 chance of being the optimal strategy at a threshold of 3 200 per DALY . In Brazil antenatal screening with syphilis RT and immediate treatment is likely to be cost effective compared with standard screening and must be prioritized in local settings .",
        "Highlights":"Latin American countries have been enacting efforts to control sexually transmitted diseases particularly focusing on elimination of mother to child syphilis transmission. Economic studies on the cost effectiveness of screening for gestational syphilis with rapid diagnostic tests during prenatal care has absolute relevance for Brazil considering the severe consequences of mother to child transmission of the disease and the high incidence of congenital syphilis in the country. We found that syphilis screening in pregnancy with a rapid test and providing treatment of women who test positive the same day of the antenatal visit is likely to be a highly cost effective strategy in Brazil. This is significant because despite the free access to treatment by pregnant women in the Unified Health System and the increased diagnosis and improved access to prenatal care the number of new cases of syphilis in pregnancy and childbirth have been increasing in recent years. Economic evaluation could help the Ministry of Health decisionmakers in setting future directions for mother to child syphilis transmission strategies and provide a better understanding of new testing technologies. Our findings indicate that strategies including rapid tests for syphilis should be reinforced and prioritized in local settings and could be extended to other low and middle income countries."

A retrospective observational cohort study of adult patients with T2D from the Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel who enrolled in a cardiovascular registry between 2013 and 2016 . Patients with established CVD between 2013 and 2016 were propensity matched 1 2 to control patients without established CVD . HRU and medical costs were extracted for a 2 year observation period and analyzed using generalized linear models . Overall 4 582 patients with established CVD were matched 1 2 to 9151 controls . HRU and costs were significantly higher in patients with established CVD versus controls across a wide range of resources . In total annual costs per patient were 10011.8 and 7206.8 in patients with established CVD and controls respectively . Hospitalizations primary care visits and medications for any condition were the main cost drivers with greater utilization and higher costs in the established CVD group versus controls In a real world setting HRU and costs were significantly higher in patients with T2D and established CVD compared with controls across the vast majority of resource types . These up to date cost estimates of CVD improve our understanding of the financial implications of established CVD beyond the direct expenses .",
        "Highlights":"Cardiovascular disease CVD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for individuals with diabetes and the largest contributor to associated healthcare costs. Previous studies assessing CVD related health expenditure underlined the cost increase which largely was due to direct expenditure in the immediate care of an acute event. A thorough analysis of the deferred impact of CV events on healthcare resource utilization HRU in the postevent period is lacking. This retrospective database analysis provides comprehensive and up to date estimates of HRU and medical costs in patients with T2D and established CVD in Israel. HRU and costs were significantly higher in patients with established CVD versus propensity matched controls across a wide range of resource types including hospitalizations primary care visits emergency room visits and medication for any condition. Furthermore hospitalizations primary care visits and medications were the key cost drivers. New international diabetes guidelines provide guidance on the prevention and management of CVD and treatment options. By characterizing and dissecting HRU and medical costs in patients with T2D either alone or in combination with CVD our findings provide valuable data for healthcare payers and insurers in evaluating the cost benefit of implementing the new guidelines. These data provide further evidence that CV complications of T2D place substantial economic burden on healthcare systems beyond immediate event related expenses."

The main objectives of the present study were to translate and culturally adapt the BDA tool into Arabic for the assessment of barriers to adherence in adolescents with T1DM in Arabic speaking populations . The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research guidelines for the translation and cultural adaptation of patient reported outcome measures were used for the process . Permission to use the instrument was obtained from the developers . This was followed by 2 forward translations of the tool into Arabic . The 2 Arabic versions were combined into a reconciled Arabic version that was then back translated into English . This was then tested against the original tool . The resultant Arabic version underwent a cognitive debriefing process to assess its comprehension and appropriateness among potential users and this resulted in further refinements leading to the final Arabic version of the tool . The translation and cognitive debriefing processes revealed issues related to the cultural or conceptual equivalence of the tool that were addressed and resolved by rewording restructuring or addition or elimination of words or phrases that in certain circumstances necessitated communications with the developers for further clarifications of the intended meaning of relevant items . This process generated an easy comprehensive clear and culturally acceptable tool as proven by the cognitive debriefing and clinical review processes .

        "Abstract":"There are challenges in conducting a budget impact analysis for rare disorders . Through this case study we present some challenges and limitations of a BIA of managing patients affected with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency . We explored a conceptual basis and barriers for health services researchers interested in quantifying budget impacts of rare disease management program . We developed a static budget impact cost calculator model in Microsoft Excel obtaining the clinical impact of a DMP from the literature and translating it into costs using OLDW . Cost inputs and resource use was obtained from 2010 to 2015 claims data using the OLDW . Insurers payments were calculated and categorized into the following cost buckets physician visits emergency room visits inpatients stays augmentation therapy other prescription drugs costs and other costs . Data were based on 6832 patients with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency identified among over 21 million OLDW enrollees observed between January 1 2010 and December 31 2015 . The introduction of a DMP was estimated to decrease costs of the management of patients with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency by 13.5 million over 5 years . The savings attributed to the program over the 5 year time horizon are due to 2555 exacerbations 5180 emergency room visits 9342 specialist visits and 105358 general practitioner visits avoided . A comprehensive DMP for a rare condition might provide cost savings to a health plan . BIAs for rare disease may be more informative if they focus on DMPs rather than on individual drugs .",
        "Highlights":"Budget impact analysis BIA considers all potentially eligible patients to receive the new intervention covered with the budget being modeled. The accuracy of such estimations depends on the availability and quality of the data in addition to BIA design with corresponding assumptions. While there are accurate prevalence estimates available for common diseases eg hypertension diabetes quantifying the prevalence of a disease has been posing substantial difficulties when it affects only a small fraction of patients rare disease . Previously the most prominent way to conduct cost studies in rare disease studies was through patient surveys. Large data sets belonging to insurers in the US open a new chapter in studying rare conditions from an economic standpoint. We present a practical case study of conducting BIA of a disease management program DMP for a small fraction of patients using the clinical impact of a DMP from the literature and then translating it into costs using OptumLabs Data Warehouse OLDW claims database. In this analysis the authors have shown a targeted DMP could be cost saving. Therefore focusing on the budget impact of a DMP rather than the cost effectiveness analysis of included drugs may be more informative for health policy decision making."

        "Abstract":"One of the core principles of rational prescribing is consideration of the cost of the medicines prescribed especially in countries with high patient copayments and low incomes such as Nigeria . Little is known about Nigerian physicians knowledge about the cost of commonly prescribed medicines . Descriptive cross sectional survey conducted among physicians in 3 tertiary institutions in Nigeria . Apart from socio demographic and other information questions about the estimated costs of branded and generic versions of 11 commonly prescribed medications were included in the questionnaire . One hundred and seventy nine respondents agreed that costs of medicines were important when writing prescriptions although only 7 of them had any formal training in the economics of healthcare . The median percentages of respondents with accurate estimated costs for generic and originator brands were 6.2 and 12 respectively . Respondents were more knowledgeable about the cost of medicines used for the treatment of infectious diseases than noncommunicable diseases . The knowledge of Nigerian physicians in the 3 participating hospitals about the costs of commonly prescribed medicines was poor . This is despite their awareness about the importance of costs of medicines when prescribing .",
        "Highlights":"Healthcare expenditure is escalating worldwide with the cost of medicines responsible for a major proportion of overall healthcare expenditure especially in lower and middle income countries where the costs of medicines can account for up to 70 of total healthcare expenditure. This is a major challenge in lower and middle income countries where the majority of the population pays out of pocket for their healthcare and where the costs of care for patients with chronic noncommunicable diseases NCDs can be potentially catastrophic. Little is currently known about physicians knowledge of the cost of medicines in Nigeria which needs to be addressed to help ensure that patients can afford the medicines they are prescribed. Otherwise there will be concerns with long term adherence to the medicines prescribed especially for chronic diseases and the subsequent impact on their health. The results of this study revealed poor knowledge of the cost of prescribed medicines for common medical conditions among physicians in tertiary healthcare facilities in Nigeria. This is not surprising because only 7 of respondents had any formal training in health economics or cost consciousness. This is a concern since tertiary hospitals are the training hospitals for future physicians in Nigeria and lack of cost consciousness here may well continue when physicians qualify and work in other settings in Nigeria. Respondents were though more knowledgeable about the cost of medicines for infectious diseases compared to NCDs such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The study reinforces the need for inclusion of cost consciousness health economics and health policy in undergraduate and postgraduate medical training curricula in Nigeria combined with regular updates. This will go a long way in ensuring the sustainable use of medicines especially for patients with NCDs in Nigeria."

To estimate the Diagnosis Related Group tariff for enteral feeding with DHM preserved by HPP the pricing process used by the Polish health technology assessment agency was followed . One way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses on costs and human milk component parameters were undertaken . HPP maintains an average of 55 more potentially beneficial DHM components than HoP but is more expensive . The DRG tariff relating to milk from human milk banks preserved by the HPP method should be about 54 higher than with HoP . The cost effectiveness ratio ranged from 0.84 to 10.27 per 1 gain in the active compound content in a daily portion of DHM . Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost of an HPP device had the most significant impact on pascalization expenses . HPP is a potentially more beneficial method of DHM preservation than HoP but it is also about 7 times more expensive . Because of high pascalization costs the cost effectiveness analysis based on clinically significant endpoints will play an important role in decision making regarding the implementation of HPP into clinical practice of human milk banking .",
        "Highlights":"Donor milk from a human milk bank is a safe and useful alternative for preterm infants in cases of an insufficient milk supply from the mother. Currently the most commonly used method of milk preservation in milk banks is Holder pasteurization. The most promising new techniquehigh pressure processingenables the preservation of active human milk components to a. extent. In this study we estimated the costs of high pressure processing of donor human milk in the context of a human milk bank in Poland and the. diagnosis related group tariff. The costs of pascalization are nearly 7 times higher than pasteurization. The cost effectiveness analysis based on clinically significant endpoints should be performed when the clinical data become available."

        "Abstract":"To assess productivity loss variations across a set of chronic diseases and analyze significant PL drivers in Hungary . Data from 11 cost of illness studies were pooled and patient level data were analyzed . A weighted multiple linear regression analysis was run to identify significant PL indicators . All costs were adjusted to 2018 euro rates and PL was further presented as a proportion of gross domestic product capita facilitating results comparability and transferability . The dataset comprised 1888 patients from 11 chronic diseases . The average indirect cost ratio was highest in schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis and lowest in benign prostatic hyperplasia . Correlation results infer that a higher EuroQol 5 dimension 3 level index score was significantly associated with lower PL . The number of hospital admissions was the main contributor toward increasing PL among resource use indicators . Age and sex showed inconsistent and insignificant correlations with PL . In regression analysis a better EuroQol 5 dimension 3 level index score and higher education were consistently associated with decreasing PL in all models . This article will enable health decision makers to understand the importance of adopting a societal perspective for chronic disease reimbursement decisions . The correlation between PL and health status supports that timely started effective treatments may prevent patients from losing their workability .",
        "Highlights":"Productivity loss PL costs and societal perspective adoption in health economic evaluations are gaining attention given their demonstrated high impact on social welfare. This is the first work in the Central and Eastern Europe region presenting such a broad pooling of PL costs for chronic diseases. This article will enable health decision makers to visualize the value of adopting a societal perspective for chronic disease reimbursement decisions. The average indirect cost gross domestic product capita was highest in schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis whereas it was lowest in benign prostatic hyperplasia. Sex PL means differences were apparent in most diseases yet it was inconsistent for a specific sex. The correlation between PL and the EuroQol 5 dimension 3 level index supports that timely started effective treatments may prevent people from losing their workability."

The official death database for the period 1998 to 2015 codified by cause of death for CVD . People with a lower educational level have an increased risk of dying prematurely owing to CVD the higher inequalities being those for young women . Inequalities by educational level grew at a rate of 2.5 per year in men and 1.7 in women despite the steady increase of HIC throughout the period . From 1998 to 2011 there was a significant decrease in mortality rates owing to CVD . As of 2011 there was an increase only for men . In Colombia educational inequalities could be a cause of the worrying increase in mortality caused by CVD which affects women more than men whereas the HIC seem to be ineffective at reducing educational inequalities and therefore mortality by CVD .",
        "Highlights":"It is assumed that increasing health insurance coverage potentially contributes to improving healthcare access among the poor and therefore reducing health inequalities. We found a reduction except during last years in mortality rates due to cardiovascular diseases in Colombia during 1998 to 2015. Meanwhile healthcare insurance coverage increased but educational inequalities grew. Health insurance coverage seems to be insufficient to achieve better health outcomes and multiple and complex strategies that go much further should be addressed."

Efforts to prioritize their prevention require not only clinical information but also information on costs that reflect the economic burden on health systems . The objective of this study was to describe cost overrun incurred from early vascular and biliary complications after liver transplant . This cases series included liver transplant patients treated at the San Vicente Foundation University Hospital Rionegro Antioquia from January 1 2013 to December 31 2018 . All liver transplant patients treated during the above period were included the absence of clinical records on the variables of interest was considered the exclusion criterion . A probabilistic analysis of patient cost was performed . Monte Carlo simulations as well as a 1 way sensitivity analysis per transplant cost component were performed . Records from 154 patients were assessed . The average patient age was 56.9 years 42.9 of patients were women . Of all 36.4 patients were classified as Child C and the average Model for End Stage Liver Disease score was 19.6 . The average cost for patients without complications was 27834.82 whereas that for patients with early vascular complications was 36747.83 and for those with early biliary complications was 38523.74 . Early vascular and biliary complications after liver transplant increase healthcare costs with the increase being significant in patients with biliary complications .",
        "Highlights":"Early vascular and biliary complications are frequent in liver transplant patients with little information available on the economic burden incurred from these complications. This is the first study to describe the nature of cost overrun incurred from these complications after liver transplant in Latin America.

These natural barriers can be modified during food processing . On the one hand processing can be applied to fully disrupt naturally present barriers while on the other hand processing can be used for targeted modifications of these barriers in order to induce specific digestive responses . In this context many researchers recently explored different processing techniques and or intensities to modify the bio encapsulation level of plant based foods aiming to enhance and or modulate nutrient release . In this review we discuss the potential of processing as a tool to manage digestive barriers in plant based foods . Two representative case studies on carotenoids and starch are included .",

In this work we present an analysis of the interaction between fiber optic evanescent wave sensors and graphite particles within a lithium ion battery over multiple cycles . Through slow charging and long rest periods the FOEWS signal has shown sensitivity to lithium concentration at the surface of graphite particles by demonstrating a response to the slow diffusion of lithium ions within graphite particles during rest periods . The slope of the FOEWS signal during a full charge is found to exhibit three distinct peaks that occur within lithiated graphite s stage transitions zones IV III and II . Deviation from the observed three peak trend correlates with significant battery capacity fade and thus indicate the sensors ability to detect capacity fade in real time . During experiments significant deviations in the slope during charging occurred at about 5 SOC and minor disturbances to the slope were observed at 80 SOC which supports limiting the depth of charge and discharge to avoid accelerated capacity fade . These results deepen our understanding of the FOEWS s interaction with lithium ion batteries and supports the development of algorithms that optimize the control and monitoring of graphite lithiation with the aim of achieving safer operation as well as maximizing capacity and battery life .",

This circumstance is mainly caused by uncertain behavior of some parameters like price . Since the forecasting techniques are usually unable to guarantee a fixed and accurate value of such parameters therefore uncertainty modeling becomes essential . This work has applied an interval based optimization model for optimal performances of intelligent parking lot of electric vehicles within severe uncertainty of upper grid price under demand response program .

        "Abstract":"Low thermal conductivity is a significant issue for the deployment of phase change based thermal energy stores . A structured methodology is required to find the best overall design in order to assess its techno economic feasibility . In this study the optimised structural configuration of graphite composites for this purpose are first considered from three different perspectives using both experimental measurements and numerical simulations . Both steady state and dynamic performance are taken into account with the latter being considered both with and without phase change . In all three cases it is demonstrated that thin parallel graphite sheets offer the most optimal results compared to other options . Resulting in the highest composite thermal conductivity measured to date at a loading of 3.5mass . The next step in achieving the best overall performance is the optimisation of this composite in the context of a plate and frame heat exchanger . For this purpose a simplified analytical model of this configuration was developed and validated . This was used in conjunction with the log mean temperature difference approach to optimise the exchanger for two typical applications low temperature low duty and high temperature high duty . The results indicate that even under an idealised configuration the system will only be suitable for high temperature applications with gas heat transfer fluids and short discharge times . For low temperature applications it may be possible to use liquid heat transfer fluids but also only for short discharge times . From an economic perspective the range of graphite sheets currently available on the market will have to be reduced in cost by two or more orders of magnitude in order to be cost effective .",

        "Abstract":"Nowadays lithium ion batteries are increasingly spreading in different areas and therefore it is very important to understand their aging behavior . According to the technical literature battery aging can be dissociated in calendar aging and cycle aging . Calendar aging in particular depends on the temperature and state of charge . In addition to the previous factors cycle aging also depends on the current rate and charge discharge cut off voltages . In the literature only a few papers have considered battery aging as a function of the charge discharge current rate but they agree that a higher current rate leads to faster battery aging . In any case all of the tests have been conducted in a climactic chamber with a constant room temperature . However even if the room temperature is controlled for high current rates the temperature of the battery cell increases which makes it impossible to distinguish the aging due to the current from that due to the temperature . For this reason in the present work the authors focused on the lithium ion battery aging due to the current rate while maintaining a constant battery temperature using opportunely controlled Peltier cells . In this way an interesting results was obtained i.e . the cycle aging is not dependent on the current rate .",

In this paper a novel method to determinate the round trip energy efficiency in pumped storage hydropower plants with underground lower reservoir is presented . Two Francis pump turbines with a power output of 124.9 and 214.7 MW and a power input of 114.8 and 199.7MW respectively have been selected to investigate the overall operation of UPSH plants .

Furthermore the model has excellent practical application effects by taking into account weather and drivers driving behaviors during real vehicular operating and the stability flexibility and robustness of this method are verified by 10 fold cross validation . In order to achieve dual control of prediction accuracy and prediction horizon we proposed an LRLSTM based joint prediction strategy while using LSTM and multiple linear regression algorithms through which an accuracy benchmark can be obtained and the prediction steps of LSTM within acceptable accuracy can be flexibly controlled .

Different directives aimed at increasing demand for electric vehicles have been put in place however due to different reasons initial predictions resulted in an insufficient number of sold units and suboptimal solutions like hybrid vehicles . Consequently the reduction in fuel consumption and pollution generation is insignificant on a global scale . The main deficiency of the electric vehicle is its battery based storage unit which due to the current state of development makes the electric vehicle less admissible for consumers . Relatively short cycle life high sensitivity to ambient conditions environmental hazards and relatively limited output power are only some of the deficiencies of the current battery technology . However a novel type of electric storage technology has recently emerged as a promising long term complement to the battery technology . Long cycle life huge power density and no environmental hazards make supercapacitor technology a viable and assuring addition to the battery storage . Furthermore supercapacitors may offer the possibility of making the electric vehicle more competitive on the market as well as a more sustainable solution . Although the supercapacitor technology is still considered to be immature and more research is needed this paper examines the possibilities and effects of using supercapacitors as part of the electric vehicle energy storage . The main goal is the analysis of the positive effects that the supercapacitor storage can have on the battery cycle life as well as on the electric vehicle performance and economy .

Accordingly by changing the method of transporting the battery the problem should be re modeled and also it is not possible to schedule the battery movements by combining two transfer methods .

To this end optimal charging or discharging power in addition to the bus location will be determined for any time period of operation .

Reactive power contribution by the battery power losses and bus voltages of the network are also counted by maintaining linear structure of the model .

The strategy differs from traditional strategies since it comprises of not only the system cost but also SOC regulation of both batteries and supercapacitors . A unique penalty cost function depending on the unutilized solar power generation and unserved demand power after HESS is fully charged or discharged has been introduced . By this penalty cost function SOC of HESS can be kept within a safer margin to guarantee the system stability . Also system availability can be assured by penalizing the unserved demand power . A new SOC regulation concept for supercapacitors has been introduced .

        "Abstract":"Hybrid energy storage systems have attracted more and more interests due to their improved performances compared with sole energy source in system efficiency and battery lifetime . This study aims to propose a real time energy management control strategy for achieving these goals . The strategy is based on a combination of wavelet transform neural network and fuzzy logic . Wavelet transform is an effective tool in extracting different frequency components of load power demand to match the characteristics of battery and supercapacitor . However it is hard to be directly applied in a real time system . For this a neural network model which is offline trained using the dataset obtained from the wavelet transform decomposition is developed to online predict the low frequency power demand for the battery . Accordingly the high frequency power demand is online calculated and distributed to the supercapacitor . In addition a fuzzy logic based supervisory controller is further developed for controlling the supercapacitor voltage within a certain suitable range . Finally a 72V battery and 96V supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system real time hardware platform has been developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed energy management control strategy .",

Direct impregnation is a cheap and easy method to embed PCM into the wood . The main shortcoming of this way is that the amount PCM is depleting over time that leads to degradation of the structure thermal mass and its capacity to store heat . In addition the presence of PCM in construction materials increases the flammability of the structures . In this study ultraviolet curable coating was used to improve containment of RT21 and propyl ester in wood and to reduce its flammability . Long exposure to storage temperature of 50 C and room ambient temperature indicated that significant improvement was achieved in PCM retention in the wood through UV coating on the wood surface . Blending ammonium polyphosphate into the lacquer improved fire safety of the PCM impregnated wood as indicated by reduced ignition time and heat release rate from cone calorimeter test . Reduction in peak heat release rate by 20.5 and 37.4 was observed in RT21 and propyl ester respectively .",

However the quantitative assessment of the benefits of load peak shaving and its impact on the distribution network remains a challenge . The present paper introduces a metric of five indexes to evaluate the technical performances of load peak shaving . This metric is applied on a case study based on a photovoltaic and battery system application for a test house in Northern Ireland whose electricity demand is representative of the average UK demand profile . Two peak shaving strategies are compared with a more usual self consumption mode and the impact of the battery size is evaluated . Peak shaving management strategies show promising performance by reducing peaks by more than 98 while still decreasing the yearly consumption by 15 and avoiding 75 of the photovoltaic generated energy to be exported back to the grid . The economic analysis compared the net present values achieved under two different tariff policies . Using a peak shaving incentivising tariff remunerating customers 0.24 per kWh of peak shaved allowed to maintain profitability with a capacity cost of up to 400 kWh compared to only 150 kWh for a usual flat tariff scheme . Such an incentive is a step forward in promoting customers to purchase a larger battery and to operate it in a way that benefits the grid operator .",

Their usage patterns are investigated based on time series association and segmentation of historical static EV data from the real world . The results show that both BEV and PHEV are mostly used as commuting vehicles with an average speed of EVs of less than 25km h and about 80 of EVs travel within 60km per day . Although there is no big difference between the speed of EVs and other models during the morning and evening rush hours low speed EVs have a significant environmental advantage over fuel vehicles . About 30 EVs have a relatively concentrated charging time between 21 0024 00 while PHEVs with small battery capacity still present a small charging peak at about 9 00 in the morning in order to continue to travel with electricity on the way home . The charging locations in urban center are more intensive than those in suburban areas and EVs are charged more frequently in summer than in winter . It is necessary to optimize the layout of charging piles and orderly charging of EVs in the case of no capacity expansion of power transmission and distribution lines .

The assay was validated and serum 2 hg levels from healthy patients were measured establishing a new comprehensive reference range for normal levels of each enantiomer . Differences in basal levels were observed between races but not sex . Age also correlated with S 2 hg levels but not R 2 hg levels . Finally serum levels of 2 hg enantiomers were measured in a pilot study of 11 patients with and without IDH mutant gliomas . An increase in R 2 hg levels was observed in 2 3 patients with actively growing IDH mutant gliomas . S 2 hg levels were increased in 4 11 patients irrespective of IDH status . The results presented demonstrate the feasibility of a GCMS MS assay for measurement of 2 hg enantiomer levels for clinical use .",

        "Abstract":"Vitamin D plays a vital role in successful pregnancy outcomes for both the mother and fetus . Vitamin D is bound to vitamin D binding protein in blood and is carried to the liver kidneys and other target tissues . Accurate measurements of the clinically measured metabolite of vitamin D 25 hydroxyvitamin D D depend on complete removal from the binding protein . It has been found that VDBP concentrations increase in maternal serum during pregnancy obfuscating the accuracy of 25D concentration measurements in pregnant women . Additionally measurements of VDBP concentrations during pregnancy have been performed using immunoassays which suffer from variations due to differences in antibody epitopes making clinical comparisons difficult . Quantification of VDBP is also of interest because changes in VDBP expression levels may indicate negative outcomes during pregnancy such as preterm delivery and restricted fetal growth . To address the need for accurate measurement of VDBP during pregnancy a method using liquid chromatography isotope dilution mass spectrometry was developed to quantify VDBP using isotopically labeled peptides as internal standards . This method was used to quantify VDBP in Standard Reference Material 1949 Frozen Human Prenatal Serum which was prepared from separate serum pools of women who were not pregnant and women during each trimester of pregnancy . VDBP concentrations were found to be lowest in the serum pool from non pregnant women and increased in each trimester . These data had good repeatability and were found to be suitable for reference value assignment of VDBP in SRM 1949 .",

        "Abstract":"LCMS MS allows for many measurands monitoring different mass transitions simultaneously . So far such alternative mass transitions are usually assessed as quantifier and qualifier ions in order to rule out interferences in individual samples . However quantification can also be based on assessment of alternative mass transitions for both the measurand and its internal standard with two distinct results for one injection of an individual sample . These paired results can be averaged . The aim of this study was to determine the potential impact of this averaging approach on measurement imprecision . We studied the impact of averaging results from different transitions for four exemplary measurands piperacillin voriconazole ethylglucuronide . Intra batch studies were performed with 21 injections of single clinical samples in sequence for each analyte and a between batch study with evaluation of data from routine QC samples from 20 series over 20weeks . CVs and their confidence intervals were assessed comparatively for quantification based on single transitions and for averaged results from these two transitions respectively . In all data sets we observed lower CVs for the averaged results compared to the results obtained from single mass transitions . CVs from averaged results were up to 39.4 lower compared to the CVs observed for results obtained from single transitions for the respective measurands . Averaging of quantification results obtained from separate mass transitions acquired simultaneously in ID LC MS MS seems to have the potential to minimize the measurement imprecision for different measurands in short and long term settings .",

Among the enzymes conferring antibiotic resistance produced by these organisms The objective of this study is to develop an intact protein mass spectrometry based method for detection and differentiation of clinically relevant KPC variants directly from bacterial cell lysates . The method should be specific for any variant expressed in multiple bacterial species limit false positive results and be rapid in nature to directly influence clinical outcomes . Lysates obtained directly from bacterial colonies were used for intact protein detection using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry . Bottom up and top down proteomic methods were used to characterize the KPC protein targets of interest . Comparisons between KPC producing and KPC non producing isolates from a wide variety of species were also performed . Characterization of the mature KPC protein revealed an unexpected signal peptide cleavage site preceding an AXA signal peptide motif modifying the molecular weight of the mature protein . Taking the additional AXA residues into account allowed for direct detection of the intact protein using top down proteomic methods . Further validation was performed by transforming a KPC harboring plasmid into a negative control strain followed by MS detection of the KPC variant from the transformed cell line . Application of this approach to clearly identify clinically relevant variants among several species is presented for KPC 2 KPC 3 KPC 4 and KPC 5 . Direct detection of these enzymes contributes to the understanding of occurrence and spread of these antibiotic resistant organisms . The ability to detect intact KPC variants via a simple LC MS MS approach could have a direct and positive impact on clinical therapy by providing both direction for epidemiological tracking and appropriate therapy .",

Clinical tests and biomarkers based on the measurement of a single or few analytes may not be able to capture the complexity of a patients disease . Novel approaches for comprehensively assessing biological processes from easily obtained samples could help in the monitoring treatment and understanding of many conditions . We propose a method of creating scores associated with specific biological processes from mass spectral analysis of serum samples . A score for a process of interest is created by identifying mass spectral features associated with the process using set enrichment analysis methods and combining these features into a score using a principal component analysis based approach . We investigate the creation of scores using cohorts of patients with non small cell lung cancer melanoma and ovarian cancer . Since the circulating proteome is amenable to the study of immune responses which play a critical role in cancer development and progression we focus on functions related to the host response to disease . We demonstrate the feasibility of generating scores their reproducibility and their associations with clinical outcomes . Once the scores are constructed only 3L of serum is required for the assessment of multiple biological functions from the circulating proteome . These mass spectrometry based scores could be useful for future multivariate biomarker or test development studies for informing treatment disease monitoring and improving understanding of the roles of various biological functions in multiple disease settings .",

Variation in CE leads to differential ion yield and optimization is usually performed empirically as tuning during method development . Our aim was to build a method to objectify the impact of collision energy settings on ion yield for individual compounds . Collision energy breakdown curves were generated based on acquisition files in which a large number of quasi identical mass transitions were recorded simultaneously with variation of CE over a defined range within a single injection . Ion yield was plotted as a curve versus CE settings . Piperacillin and testosterone were studied as exemplary analytes in matrix free and serum matrix based liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry measurements . More detailed testosterone CE breakdown curves were investigated with regard to sample preparation techniques and the isotope labeling pattern of corresponding internal standards . CE breakdown curves were found characteristically for the piperacillin quantifier transition with respect to CE related maximum ion yield as well as curve width and shape . A diverging curve profile was observed for the piperacillin qualifier transition . For testosterone analyses no impact from different sample preparation techniques or the isotope labeling patterns on the selected CE was shown .

Much of our current understanding of fentanyl and fentanyl analog use in our communities comes from postmortem toxicology findings . In the clinical settings of addiction medicine and pain management where the opioid abuse potential is high the use of fentanyl as well as specific fentanyl analogs may be underestimated due to limited plasma testing and limited availability of assays with suitable analytical sensitivity and selectivity to detect misuse of fentanyls . We report plasma and blood assays for 17 fentanyls in clinical and medical examiner casework . A mixed mode solid phase extraction of diluted plasma or precipitated blood was optimized for maximum recovery of the fentanyls with minimized matrix effects . Analysis was performed using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC I Class interfaced with a Waters Xevo TQ S micro tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer . Method parameters were optimized and validated for precision accuracy carryover linearity and matrix effects . Application studies were performed in postmortem blood obtained in 44 fentanyl related fatalities and in serial plasma samples from 18 surgical patients receiving intravenous fentanyl therapy while undergoing parathyroidectomy . Fentanyls found in postmortem cases included fentanyl norfentanyl despropionyl fentanyl beta hydroxy fentanyl acetyl fentanyl acetyl norfentanyl methoxyacetyl fentanyl furanyl fentanyl cyclopropyl fentanyl and para fluorobutyryl fentanyl with fentanyl norfentanyl 4 ANPP and OH fentanyl predominating in frequency . Fentanyl concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 56ng mL and fentanyl was nearly always found with 4 ANPP norfentanyl and OH fentanyl . Concentrations of other fentalogs ranged from 1 to 84ng mL . In the surgical cases fentanyl was detected and quantified along with norfentanyl and OH fentanyl but without detection of 4 ANPP in any of the samples . The association and relative concentrations of OH fentanyl fentanyl and norfentanyl in the postmortem and clinical studies indicated a metabolic rather than an illicit source of OH fentanyl .",

Application of the method in medical examiner casework shows a range of fentanyls involved in the fatalities including 4 ANPP and beta hydroxy fentanyl. Application in pharmaceutical administration of fentanyl shows no evidence of the fentanyl precursor 4 ANPP and the presence of beta hydroxy fentanyl.

In the last decade the use of immobilized biocatalysts in flow is growing rapidly yet the immobilization protocols need to be optimized . In this review we have discussed the most fundamental aspects to be considered when designing immobilized enzymes for productive and stable operations in flow . Furthermore we analyze the protein loading the activity recovery the space time yield the specific productivity and the turnover number as complementary metrics to assess the efficiency and longevity of immobilized enzymes integrated into flow reactors . The science of the immobilization implies the engineering of the surfaceprotein interface the material features and the reactor design to achieve highly active and robust heterogeneous biocatalysts under continuous operations . Hence we encourage the flow biocatalysis community to accompany those engineering efforts with accurate assessments of both activity and stability .",

Subcritical and supercritical water provide a strongly oxidant environment which can deal with this waste by allowing the obtention of high added value products from waste of synthetic polymers . These processes when carefully optimized using chemometric methods produce fuels and even the initial monomers that can be used for polymer synthesis reducing the direct demand for fossil raw materials in a circular economy approach .",

Water systems increasingly exhibit fragility to extreme weather events and changing climate conditions . The concept of resilience offers a framework to improve water system design for uncertain futures by incorporating capabilities such as persistence adaptability and transformability . Existing formalizations of resilience in engineering design however are dependent on assumptions of climate and hydrologic stationarity and of well characterized uncertainty rendering them obsolete relative to our current understanding of the uncertainties we face . In this paper we use methods based on decision making under deep uncertainty to establish a methodology to design for the resilience of water systems . The formulation generates water system design options that provide resilience capabilities at least cost and specify the optimal choices for persistence adaptability and transformability for performance over a wide range of possible futures . As it was developed for application beyond water systems the Resilience by Design is a generalizable approach offering important new methods of planning and managing for the resilience of critical infrastructure .",

In the past hydro climatological droughts led to serious water shortages resulting in crop shortfalls significant economic loss and inter state political tensions . Robust forecasts of anomalous climatic and hydrological conditions may reduce regional vulnerability to hydro climatic extremes and thus can serve as a scientific basis for national and trans national water management . Based on a synthesis of international literature and on our decadal long experience in the region we systematically review the scientific progress in seasonal forecasting and evaluate the potential for a scientifically informed water management . Additionally we discuss to what extent the scientific progress meets the requirements of stakeholders and reveal major obstacles for a sustainable knowledge transfer . Our review shows that exceptionally skillful discharge forecasts for the agricultural relevant vegetation season can be derived by means of statistical models taking remote sensing based estimations of the snow coverage in the Central Asian mountain regions as independent covariates . The consideration of global climate indices in particular El Nio allows to extend the forecast lead times . However decision makers are often not aware of the scientific progress and its implications for improved water management . Despite the continuous international effort with regard to knowledge transfer and capacity development modernization at Central Asian water management institutions is proceeding slowly . A continuous engagement in the field of capacity development and knowledge dissemination at various institutional levels appears necessary in order to stimulate a multi disciplinary network and to support a sustainable regional collaboration in the water sector .",

Second the pastoral aesthetic preference prompts the dissatisfaction with low impact development that aims to effectively and sustainably manage stormwater because of its unkempt appearance . The 1987 National Pollution Discharge Elimination System initiated a regulatory framework that not only considered human wellbeing but ecological health thereby instigating a challenge to anthropocentrism . With Phase I and Phase II the NPDES stormwater program explicitly include specific measures to regulate stormwater discharges and promote the implementation and appreciation of LID .

Recognising that climatic risks attenuate this water availability various adaptation options have been implemented in the water sector . To inform adaptation prioritisation it is critical to assess the growing literature on adaptation options related to water management and synthesise lessons on which options are feasible and under what conditions . We assess the multidimensional feasibility of adaptation options in the water sector at the global scale using two examples strategies to improve irrigation efficiency in rural areas and sustainable water management in urban areas . To contextualise the assessment and showcase how adaptation feasibility is regionally differentiated we present two case studies flood management in Jakarta and Rotterdam and community based watershed management in India and the Dry Corridor of Central America specifically Guatemala and Honduras . The assessment highlights that while improving irrigation efficiency is technically feasible and has economic benefits it is constrained by issues of replicability and trade offs across scale and institutional barriers . In urban areas flood management measures are technologically and geophysically feasible but barriers such as inadequate institutional capacities constrain their feasibility . We also assess mitigation and sustainable development synergies and trade offs for the two adaptation options .

This research investigated important aspects such as surgery immunosuppression ischemia reperfusion injury rejection and fertility . In 2013 the first clinical uterus transplantation trial started and this was a live donor trial including nine transplantations . The first live birth was reported in 2014 and this has been followed by several more births from the initial trial in Sweden but also from other trials . The published uterus transplantations procedures both from live donors and deceased donors will be reviewed in detail . The surgical procedures to harvest a uterus from a live or from a deceased donor have developed and minimal invasive techniques are being introduced in live donor surgery for uterus transplantation . Some modifications of anatomical sites of venous outflows have been introduced . The efficiency of the procedure in terms of surgical success with viable grafts after one month as well as the rate of successful transplantations with live births as the primary endpoint have proven to be high .

Here we propose a potential mechanism which may be underlying the slow enhancement of skills and schemas by examining the biological events which take place during NREM and REM sleep . We suggest that the immediate benefits of sleep are mainly due to reactivation during NREM sleep while the delayed effects are mainly due to plasticity related changes occurring at the molecular cellular and system levels and which require long periods of time to occur . There is increasing evidence that these events may take place preferentially during REM sleep thus shedding further light on the function of this sleep stage .",

As the results obtained in reptiles were unconvincing this suggested for years that only homeothermic species have REM sleep . However recent studies in lizards also suggest the presence of two electrophysiological states and provide a better picture of their sleep . Nevertheless due to differences in the expression of these states in two lizard species as well as missing information homology with mammalian REM sleep still could not be established . As ectotherms and homeotherms have very different physiology and neuroanatomy we expect that even if a state like REM sleep exists in ectotherms its phenotypic expression should be different . Therefore we think that a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of REM sleep will come from efforts to examine both the similarities and difference between sleep states in homeotherms and ectotherms .",

However none of these studies provides enough clues to postulate a true homology with mammalian REM sleep. As reptiles are not capable of expressing all the traits that define mammalian REM sleep the quest to identify the same state in reptiles could be unfounded.

        "Abstract":"In mammals including humans the convention defining rapid eye movement sleep also called paradoxical sleep states that it is mainly characterized by a low voltage fast electrocortical rhythms rapid eye movements and a muscle atonia occasionally accompanied by brief distal twitches . When facing sleep pathologies all these criteria are not always met and identifying REM sleep becomes thus a challenge . Here we review such criteria and report the adjustments proposed to identify and measure REM sleep in animal models of sleep pathologies such as REM sleep Behaviour Disorder and narcolepsy type 1 . We also argue that video recordings synchronized to multi parametric polysomnography are mandatory to recognize REM sleep and differentiate it from dissociated states in animal models of sleep disorders .",
        "Highlights":"A consensual definition for transitions from NREM to REM sleep is needed to compare data obtained in different laboratories. The use of multi parametric polysomnography is of great help to score vigilance states in animal models of sleep disorders. Video recording synchronized to polysomnography is necessary to analyse vigilance states in animal models of sleep pathologies. Video recording is required to appropriately recognize REM sleep from potential dissociated states."

        "Abstract":"The human brain contains 100 billion neurons and each neuron can have up to 200 000 connections to other neurons . Recent advancements in neuroscience ranging from molecular studies in animal models to behavioral studies in humans have given us deeper insights into the development of this extraordinarily intricate system . Studies show a complex interaction between biological predispositions and environment while gross neuroanatomy and low level functions develop early prior to receiving environmental inputs functional selectivity is shaped through experience governed by the maturation of local excitatory and inhibitory circuits and synaptic plasticity during sensitive periods early in development . Plasticity does not end with the closing of the early sensitive period the environment continues to play an important role in learning throughout the lifespan . Recent work delineating the cascade of events that initiates controls and ends sensitive periods offers new hope of eventually being able to remediate various clinical conditions by selectively reopening plasticity .",
        "Highlights":"The development of gross neuroanatomy precedes experience dependent plasticity. A cascade of neurochemical and structural events mediated by experience driven neural activity controls the sensitive period. Environmental manipulations such as sensory deprivation have an impact on the timeline of the sensitive period. Prolonged sensory deprivation early in development results in cross modal plasticity."

        "Abstract":"Being able to pick out particular sounds such as speech against a background of other sounds represents one of the key tasks performed by the auditory system . Understanding how this happens is important because speech recognition in noise is particularly challenging for older listeners and for people with hearing impairments . Central to this ability is the capacity of neurons to adapt to the statistics of sounds reaching the ears which helps to generate noise tolerant representations of sounds in the brain . In more complex auditory scenes such as a cocktail party where the background noise comprises other voices sound features associated with each source have to be grouped together and segregated from those belonging to other sources . This depends on precise temporal coding and modulation of cortical response properties when attending to a particular speaker in a multi talker environment . Furthermore the neural processing underlying auditory scene analysis is shaped by experience over multiple timescales .",
        "Highlights":"Sound perception in noisy environments is a major challenge for the auditory system. Adaptation to sound statistics helps to form noise tolerant neural representations. Sound segmentation requires precise temporal coding in the auditory system. Perceptual features for segmentation undergo statistical and long term learning. Attended objects have enhanced spectrotemporal representations in auditory cortex."
